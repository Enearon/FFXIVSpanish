1,Kill It with Fire,"Clarricie's latest ploy is to send the loathsome seedkin Peerifool into the fray. Its cloying stench alone is enough to repel all but the most steadfast of warriors, and even they will struggle to withstand its relentless assault."
2,The Baying of the Hound(s),"Following a series of resounding defeats, the imperial mages have resorted to desperate measures by summoning the ferocious Canis Dirus. Whether each of its three heads is capable of independent thought is unclear, but they are all equally determined to devour as many Resistance fighters as possible."
3,Vigil for the Lost,"The experimental magitek soldier Dabog has been assigned to pilot Vigilia, the culmination of the Empire's research into scorpion-type warmachina. This unit alone would level the Resistance's base of operations if allowed to draw too close, so every effort must be made to silence it."
4,Aces High,"Dabog, the magitek-enhanced pilot, takes to the air in one of the most advanced weapons at the Empire's disposal: the flying warmachina known simply as Gabriel. If allowed to continue strafing the Resistance front line, your comrades will have little hope of reaching the enemy castrum."
5,The Shadow of Death's Hand,"The Empire has unleashed the dreaded Akbaba, a winged fiend that feasts on the corpses of those slain in battle. It is also not opposed to going the extra malm and creating said corpses itself, specifically from members of the Resistance. "
6,The Final Furlong,"Llofii has freed the experimental monoceros from her former masters and the unlikely pair are making good their escape. Just as it seems they will finally be able to put the Empire behind them, the deadly Spartoi appears to block their path."
7,The Hunt for Red Choctober,"Unlike their yellow-plumed cousins, the red chocobo is rarely a welcome sight, least of all on the battlefield. None are more belligerent than the particularly large specimen known as Red Comet, who has been a constant nuisance to both sides of the conflict since he first arrived."
8,Beast of Man,"Known for his unmatched command of a variety of ferocious beasts, Lyon is one of the most feared adversaries the Bozjan Resistance has faced to date. This formidable foe must be overcome for them to have any chance at victory."
9,The Fires of War,"The mages serving the Empire have decided to pursue a more explosive means of subduing their foes. As such, they have deployed several pyroboli to quite literally level the playing field."
10,Patriot Games,"The Empire's magitek soldiers possess a wealth of machina with which to torment their foes, but few are more nightmarish than the Patriot. With its far-reaching appendages and all-seeing optical sensors, it is designed to utterly destroy those who would dare violate the borders of Garlean territory. "
11,Trampled under Hoof,"Though it may seem no more than a rather large and unsightly bovine at first glance, the eale is in fact one of the deadliest creatures at the Empire's command. It also has an extraordinarily high threshold for pain, and is not afraid to dish out a fair share in return."
12,And the Flames Went Higher,"Of all the mages assigned to the IVth Legion, Sartauvoir quo Soranus is one of the most experienced...and most sadistic. The Bozjan southern front has provided him with the perfect arena to demonstrate his remarkable control of flame and take part in his favorite pastime: burning people alive."
13,Metal Fox Chaos,"While Sicinius mal Vellutus is known for restoring ancient machinery, he is not one to snub more recent technological advancements. One such example is the Dáinsleif, an impressive nine-tailed warmachina that resembles a fox in appearance and animalistic cunning."
14,Rise of the Robots,"Sicinius mal Vellutus's apparent obsession with perfecting his series of constructs has given rise to his most dangerous creation yet. If you were to reduce this mechanical fiend to scrap metal, perhaps it would discourage your imperial adversary from any further dabbling. Or perhaps not."
15,Where Strode the Behemoth,"Chlevnik is the result of experimental combat drugs being used on the corpse of a behemoth, forcing it back to life. Racked with agony, it seeks to exact its revenge on mankind for the terrible fate that has befallen it."
16,The Battle of Castrum Lacus Litore,"At long last, the enemy stronghold is but a stone's throw away. With your Resistance comrades at your side, all that remains is the final assault."
17,On Serpents' Wings,A cadre of mages has summoned a knot of winged serpents to bar the Resistance's path. You must see their plans unraveled if you mean to overcome the IVth Legion.
18,Feeling the Burn,"Heavily inspired by the technological marvel of the helldivers, the imperials have launched their latest prototype, the blackburn, in a desperate attempt to extinguish the Resistance's hopes of victory."
19,The Broken Blade,"Dabog has been reforged into a foul new weapon, a creature malformed beyond recognition. This thinking, unfeeling biological weapon has but a singular purpose..."
20,From Beyond the Grave,"For the IVth Legion Zealots, death is a small price to pay to bring ruin to their enemies. A price they paid quite willingly to summon forth the dread spirit Shemhazai."
21,With Diremite and Main,The IVth Legion's beastmasters have a penchant for collecting the most fearsome creatures known to the realm. And now they have unleashed their prized catch from the Burn to turn back the Resistance.
22,Here Comes the Cavalry,The IVth Legion's reinforcements have arrived in the form of unmanned magitek horsemen. They must be stopped if the Resistance is to advance.
23,Head of the Snake,"You at last stand face-to-face with Menenius sas Lanatus, commanding officer of the IVth Legion's forces in Bozja. Defeat him, and you may deal the heaviest of blows to the imperials' morale."
24,There Would Be Blood,"An imperial mage detachment has called down Hanbi, bringer of ruin, to expunge the Resistance from the plateaus of Zadnor. This otherworldly being demands a tribute of blood, and its thirst is insatiable."
25,Never Cry Wolf,"The mighty Hrodvitnir descends upon the battlefield, a beast of legend known to leave naught but icy ruin in its wake. Can the Resistance escape the grip of its gelid jaws?"
26,Time to Burn,"A creature of flame, thought to exist outside the boundaries of time, this 4th-make Belias is bound to the IVth Legion's mages, and it is compelled now to reduce the Resistance to ashes."
27,"Lean, Mean, Magitek Machines","Sicinius has a near-limitless supply of mechanical horrors to assail the Resistance, and it is clear he spared no effort in building this latest entourage of magitek weapons to bar their path."
28,Worn to a Shadow,"The IVth Legion has grown woefully desperate to unleash this beast upon the Resistance. It is said the alkonost casts no shadow until it has killed a man and claims theirs as its own. Thankfully for the alkonost, it now has plenty to choose from."
29,A Familiar Face,"Auracite taken from the High Seraph Ultima is said to grant its wielder their heart's desire...for a price. A price the IVth Legion Zealots paid gladly, confident this unspeakable horror will put an end to the Resistance."
30,Looks to Die For,"Ayida's scales are said to be so resplendent, so beautiful, that a man could die of bliss from the mere sight of them. Her victims, were they still alive, would assure you it was her bone-crushing strength and venomous bite that did them in."
31,Taking the Lyon's Share,"Lyon has grown restless waiting in the wings, and would see the Resistance brought low by his own hands. Has anyone the strength to tame this feral beast once and for all?"
32,The Dalriada,"The Dalriada's engines have failed, forcing it to the ground. The Resistance would seize this opportunity to storm the warship, and at last put an end to the imperials' presence in Bozja."
