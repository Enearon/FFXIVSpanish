2002722,"Fortunately, the soulstone remained unscathed despite its owner being smashed to smithereens."
2002723,"This expertly brewed Crystarium ale continues a long tradition of bearing a seemingly unfathomable name. It is said that the first person to take a swig was so impressed by its robust, earthy notes that she was left quite speechless, with only her raised eyebrow any indication of the impression it had made on her."
2002724,Specially designed to prevent the naked flame within from coming into contact with dangerous gases present in the mines.
2002725,"Even in the dim glow of a safety lamp, this many-faceted gem emits a dazzling sparkle. It beggars belief that the miner who lost it was unable to find it by himself."
2002726,"It is hard to imagine that coins could have become this rusty in the years since the Ronso left Kelk, so it seems that they were kept as historic artifacts rather than as valid currency."
2002727,"Why the Ronso, like so many other races, choose to depict their people's history on pieces of tableware is anyone's guess."

2002731,"It is commonly believed that striped stones are formed inside the bodies of gnomes, with the age of the creature indicated by the number of stripes. Whether a single band indicates a period equal to a year, a decade, or a century is the cause of much debate among geologists."

2002734,"While it is unclear what causes this oil to emit such a distinctive and unpleasant smell, it is perhaps best not to ask."
2002735,"Not only is it exquisitely decorated, it also appears to be far too large and cumbersome to be carried by a miner at work."
2002736,"Although the Talos from which these parts were requisitioned has lain dormant for many years, the inner workings have been shielded from the elements and are in remarkable condition."

2002749,Some items warrant no description.
2002750,A worn sack bearing a bottle of pristine water.
2002751,A lamp that glows with the magic of the pixies.

2002762,"While not all of the flotsam that washes onto the shores of Kholusia is suitable for being used as building material, many local beggars find they are in no position to be choosers."
2002763,"Any beachcomber worth their salt would be a fool to pass up such a fine piece of wreckage. Strong enough to hold up even the most rickety of shacks, it also doubles as a handy cudgel in times of emergency."
2002764,"Used by the pixies of Il Mheg to make a mildly intoxicating punch. Strangely enough, the word “punch” often comes to the minds of those who encounter the fae folk when they are in their cups."
2002765,"A punch made from this particularly potent strain of sap can keep a pixie in a drunken stupor for days on end. Thankfully, the catastrophic hangover that ensues is normally ample punishment for any mischief they may have caused."
2002766,"If you think carrying a bunch of logs around is backbreaking work, try doing it after they have been left to soak in water for goodness knows how long."
2002767,A whole bag of these should be worth at least a cow.

2002772,It is said that even touching this potent variety of dream algae with bare skin can result in one instantly losing consciousness. Gloves are a must when handling this rare crop.
2002773,"Despite being dried in the arid desert plains of Amh Araeng, this discarded wood is an excellent building material, provided it is kept well away from open flames."
2002774,"Some botanists claim that the oil within nourishes the plant in its first days after sprouting. When used to make cooking oil, the distinctive fragrance enhances even the most basic of meals."
2002775,The patients who drink the medicine made from this hardy plant are usually not told its name for fear they might gag on the mixture.
2002776,The finer examples of this robust shrub are said to even more closely resemble the fine fuzz that covers the posteriors of its namesakes.
2002777,Its reputation for being resistant to water and other liquids makes it an ideal choice for casks.
2002778,Being almost entirely impervious to woodworm makes this oak ideal for items built to last.
2002779,"When the plants are allowed to grow large enough, the leaves resemble elves's ears, though the owners of said ears vehemently deny this for some reason."
2002780,"This algae-like plant lines the lakebed of the Source, and when viewed from above the water's surface, appears akin to a grassy meadow."

2002782,"Though few would argue that this distinctive stone deserves a place amongst fine gemstones and the like, it nonetheless possesses a unique appeal for the discerning collector."
2002783,"Even in its uncut state, it makes for an attractive paperweight."
2002784,It is best to avoid saying the name of this substance near the coastal region's female residents.
2002785,Quite how this differs from iron ore found anywhere else would require a lengthy explanation that no one with sense could possibly be interested in.
2002786,"For most metalworkers dealing with such materials, “exceptional” is another word for “big.”"
2002787,"Many claim it to possess arcane properties, and is a popular choice for charms and such."
2002788,The lost Kingdom of Voeburt once used rocks such as these to line the walls of their defensive structures due to its unique magical properties.
2002789,"Although many people would assume that all sapphires are blue, they in fact come in a variety of colors. Like pink, for example."
2002790,"Supposedly, this crystal will protect the bearer from all manner of evils and misfortunes. Whether this includes the mischievous residents of Il Mheg remains to be seen."
2002791,"Worryingly, this peculiar substance is not as rare as one might expect. Proof─if any were needed─that Rak'tika has more than its fair share of suspicious characters."
2002792,"For gravel to become coated in poison to this extent would require multiple applications, meaning that the substance in question was spilled at the same location more than once. Given the Children of the Everlasting Dark's proclivity for mixing poison, this is not as unlikely as it sounds."
2002793,The green coloration makes this valuable gem surprisingly hard to find among the lush vegetation of Rak'tika.
2002794,"Said to have splintered off from Fruit of the Protector, an enormous crystal that predates the Ronkan Empire."
2002795,"Fragments of Fruit of the Protector come in various shapes and sizes, but only a few are considered to be perfect."

2002798,"Though the passing of time has not been kind to the abandoned Talos, the parts less exposed to the elements may still be used."
2002799,The alloy from which such parts were crafted is almost entirely impervious to corrosion.
2002800,Those charged with fortifying the defensive walls of the Crystarium will accept just about any materials they can get their hands on. This should help fill in some of the larger cracks that have appeared.
2002801,It would be wasteful to leave such fine building materials to gather moss in Lakeland.
2002802,"While certainly a rare stone, its popularity pales in comparison with better-known gems. It is, however, favored by connoisseurs who have grown tired of the usual emeralds, rubies, and the like."
2002803,"Though it may appear to many as a fine, uncut jewel, it is in fact nothing more than a lump of hardened salt. Its true value is revealed when it is ground down and used in medicine."
2002804,"While it may be little more than crystallized salt, it is nonetheless considered to be attractive enough to be used in jewelry. Its scrapings may also be used as seasoning when supplies of regular salt run low."

2002817,Fat and juicy worms ideally suited for fish bait writhe and squirm in this sack.
2002818,A simple wooden crate that you unearthed at the spot marked on the map. What treasures could it hold?
2002819,Shimmering nectar so sweetly fragrant it may as well have come straight out of a faerie tale.
2002820,"This fractured piece of earthenware was once part of an urn used to store poison. Although the contents have long since been removed, it would still be advisable to wash your hands after touching such an object."
2002821,Even a scholar well versed in the ways of the ancient Ronkans would struggle to identify this bizarre relic.
2002822,"After the feathers of a tarichuk have been made into arrow flights, the oily sheen reduces wind resistance."

2002827,This popular ale was named after one of the regulars in the establishment where the brew was perfected. Rumors that said patron was also involved in the carbonation process are unfounded.
2002828,One piece taken from a stockpile that could have found its way out of the Ostall Imperative in any number of ways.
2002829,"According to some patrons, it is the <hex:021A020203>only<hex:021A020103> mulled wine available at Clearmelt, thus making it the finest by default."
2002830,"Partially digested and still dripping with saliva and stomach juice, this sturdy leather sack seems to have miraculously protected its contents from significant damage."

2002832,A medicinal tincture supplied to the Crystarium guard to ease wounds and soothe aches and pains.
2002833,A piece of parchment detailing an extensive array of building materials and other supplies needed at the Ostall Imperative.
2002834,The experience of biting into this juicy fruit is best described as hosting a fête inside your mouth to which everyone has been extended an invitation.
2002835,"Contrary to the spearfisher's dismissive description, this collection of fresh fish is not all that disappointing. Perhaps he simply has exceedingly high standards?"
2002836,In keeping with the time-honored tradition of using the flesh of a small creature to lure out a larger one.
2002837,"Entrusted to you by Amshs Aath, this Ondo creation can be employed during your battle with the amphisbaena to befuddle its senses and improve your chances."
2002838,Hopefully these scales will serve to shield the Ondo better than they did the amphisbaena before them.

2002844,A bottle deprived of its contents and unceremoniously dumped on the beach by a long-since-departed faire-goer.
2002845,This modestly sized bottle appears to house a missive of sorts.

2002847,Removing this letter from its glass house has sadly done little to enlighten you as to the import of the words writ upon it.
2002848,"A brown paper parcel tied up with string, like as not to contain a few of Chathwick's favorite things."
2002849,Food lovingly prepared by Heggie.
