2162688,Barracuda Piers,"These docks provide safe mooring for the Thalassocratic Navy's principal squadrons, also known as the Crimson Fleet. To prevent sabotage, admittance to the area is forbidden to the general citizenry; however, on clear days, one may catch a glimpse of the armada flagship, the <hex:021A020203>Triumph<hex:021A020103>, from atop one of Limsa Lominsa's myriad spans."
2162689,The <hex:021A020203>Astalicia<hex:021A020103>,"Registered as a trade vessel hailing from foreign waters, this battle-scarred warship captained by the lord of the region's underworld, Hyllfyr, serves as a gathering place for brigands, cutthroats, and the purveyors of sundry other breeds of villainy. It is here that the city–state's many pirate crews find new recruits to join their ranks."
2162690,Seasong Grotto,"“I am the waves that bear, I am the winds that guide.<hex:02100103>I am the evening stars, I am the morning sky.<hex:02100103>I am born of the sea, and there shall I die.”<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>Nestled within a shallow cavern situated to the south of Summerford Farms sits an ancient monolith upon which is carved this, the Sailors' Requiem."
2162691,The Skylift,"Once an endless expanse of flat, rocky meadows, middle La Noscea is now severed atwain by a sheer cliff known as the Descent. To maintain overland trade routes from the easterly outposts of Aleport and Bronze Lake, Lominsan engineers created the Skylift─a tower of wooden scaffolding outfitted with pulleys, winches, and lighter-than-air balloons."
2162692,La Thagran Eastroad,"When the <hex:021A020203>Galadion<hex:021A020103> fell victim to the Navigator's fury and ran aground on the southern shores of Vylbrand seven hundred years ago, it was her two helmsmen, Jean De Nevelle and Guy La Thagran, who were tasked with exploring the newfound island─the former heading east, the latter, west. To this day, their routes still serve as La Noscea's two main thoroughfares."
2162693,The Salt Strand,"When struck by a fallen shard from Dalamud's outer shell, a massive amount of concentrated aether was released from just below the surface of the Rhotano Sea, immediately fusing with and crystallizing the towering fount of saltwater which was expelled during the impact. City–state-funded exploratory forays into the inner crater have all yet to return..."
2162694,Red Rooster Stead,"The farmers on the Red Rooster Stead will rarely shy from testing their agricultural acumen on exotic crops or untested growing methods, and take pride in their willingness to sacrifice a harvest if it means a better yield an autumn hence. The plantation's name is said to be taken from the bloody cockfights held after nightfall by the gamekeeps."
2162695,The Brewer's Beacon,"This relatively new lighthouse was built soon after the Calamity claimed Swiftperch Tower to ensure safe passage for trade vessels carrying shipments of dark stouts and blonde barleywines out of Aleport. In addition, the candlekeeps also keep watch for increasingly frequent rogue tidal waves caused by the stirrings of the Lord of the Whorl."
2162696,The Leatherworkers' Guild,"Crafters for the realm-famous Atelier Fen-Yll, the Leatherworkers' Guild boasts the finest tawers and tanners in all Eorzea. In recent years, the workshop has come to be known for its Geva patterns, which outline methods of working and cutting hides, pelts, skins, and furs in a way that honors the elementals within by minimizing waste."
2162697,Apkallu Falls,"Named after a failed attempt by an ambitious Gridanian merchant to hatch and breed apkallus in the linn, Apkallu Falls is most remembered for serving as a place of meditation for the late Louisoix Leveilleur, Circle of Knowing Archon and hero of Eorzea."
2162698,Bentbranch Meadows,"Once Moogle's Gift Mounts was established and its rookery stocked with Ishgard's finest birds, it was not long before an entire settlement had grown up around the stables. The trademark balloon tethered to the main building is actually an Ixali war vessel claimed by chocobokeeps after it became tangled in a nearby tree and was abandoned by its riders."
2162699,The Sanctum of the Twelve,"This sky-scraping ivory cathedral was built following the Age of Endless Frost─a dark period in which the realm was overrun with famine and disease─to serve as a place of refuge and respite for all who sought succor. Soon after, however, it fell into ruin and was all but forgotten...until the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era saw need for its rise once again."
2162700,Little Solace,"Little is the solace granted to those sylphs who would voice their opposition to the summoning of the Lord of Levin. Little is the solace bequeathed upon those who would abandon their homes in the Sylphlands and shun their frenzied brethren. Thus, it is only through fraternity that those sylphs may ultimately find solace, however little it may be."
2162701,Royal Promenade,"In times when the sultan had sole rule over the city–state, the Promenade would serve as an ersatz waiting chamber for those petitioners who sought audience with His Resplendence in the Fragrant Chamber. Now, with power in the hands of the Syndicate, the round is empty, save for the occasional tryst betwixt young nobles."
2162702,The Gold Court,"A large atrium in the heart of Ul'dah, the Gold Court's opulence and scale make it a popular meeting place for the city's elite. The plaza was once reserved for the sultan's private balls, but has since been opened to the public due to a lack of funds to maintain the majestic hanging fountain at her center."
2162703,The Jewel of the Desert,"The commercial hub of Ul'dah is organized strategically around the dome-shaped citadel at its center. Its towering fortifications and protective outer walls bedighted with myriad glass panes and colorful mosaics are visible for malms in all directions, and serve as a stark yet dazzling deterrent to would-be besiegers."
2162704,The Ruins of Sil'dih,The city–states of Ul'dah and Sil'dih coexisted for generations until four hundred years ago when bad blood festering betwixt the two sultanates culminated in the War of the Sisters─leaving Sil'dih a smoldering pile of rubble to be claimed by the shifting desert sands. The subsequent relocation of Ul'dah placed the city–state nearly directly above her fallen sibling.
2162705,The Lonely Giant,"Local legend claims the Lonely Giant is everything from the ghost of a Sil'dihn sultan, to the prototype for a new model of Garlean machina. Ul'dahn scholars, however, simply believe him a Coerthan goobbue who lost his bearings during the chaos of the Calamity, and after a long journey through the Black Shroud, died of exhaustion upon reaching Thanalan."
2162706,The Invisible City,"Buried under nearly a malm of solid rock, if not for a gaping rent torn open by the Calamity, these ancient ruins may have gone undiscovered for another thousand summers. Scholars sent to Highbridge to study the site are currently of a mind that the structures are not a city, but in fact the tomb of one Lalafuto IV, famed sultan of Belah'dia."
2162707,Highbridge,"After the Calamity rent eastern Thanalan asunder, one of the first projects commissioned by the Syndicate was the construction of a bridge to span the newly formed chasm and restore the trade route with lands transpontine. The city which has sprung up along its edges is populated almost solely by scholars investigating the nearby ruins of the Invisible City."
2162708,Woad Whisper Canyon,"Little more than a shallow valley but five years past, Woad Whisper Canyon was carved into a gaping gorge in a matter of moons after the Calamity drained Bronze Lake and dramatically altered the course of the Nym River. On hot days, laborers from both Summerford Farms and the Skylift will oft take respite in the cool mists of the falls...if not met by bandits."
2162709,Summerford Farms,"When Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn rose to Admiral, one of her first decrees included the clearing of large swaths of land for new Lominsan settlements. Summerford Farms and its expansive orange groves is one of those locations─its name is derived from the man-made crossings required when late spring runoff from Mt. O'Ghomoro causes the Rogue River to swell."
2162710,The Grey Fleet,"Sitting high atop Widow Cliffs on the southeastern coast of Vylbrand, the Grey Fleet was built to harness the constant southerly winds funneled down through the Strait of Merlthor, and use them to power the many mills which grind the region's wheat and full its wool."
2162711,Hidden Falls,"Sheltered on three sides by towering cliffs, Hidden Falls can be found several score yalms upstream from where the Agelyss River empties into the Strait of Merlthor. Taken by its beauty, Ul'dahn plutocrat Gegeruju was quick to purchase the land and construct a stage upon which private performances for the magnate's favored clients are held."
2162712,Gullperch Tower,"One of three beacons built along the La Noscean coast in the Sixth Astral Era, Gullperch Tower is the easternmost─warning ships navigating the Strait of Merlthor of its deadly shallows, while also serving as a watchtower for pirate and Sahagin raids on Bloodshore."
2162713,The Navigator,"Carved centuries past by a famous Roegadyn sculptor, this massive stone effigy located in the center of Aleport's lower plaza serves as hallowed ground upon which sailors might offer solemn prayers to the watcher of the seas before embarking on their journeys across the untamed deep. "
2162714,The Ship Graveyard,"For centuries, ships wrecked off the shores of southern Vylbrand have been carried upon currents to this quiet inlet─a timeless reminder of the deep's boundless wrath. So many are the wooden corpses which populate this watery lichyard, it is said that for every hull visible above the waves, a score more slumber beneath."
2162715,Camp Skull Valley,"Now a strategic outpost for the Maelstrom, Camp Skull Valley was once but a circle of tents occupied by a meager Yellowjacket unit charged with surveilling the area for kobold incursions. Those beastmen foolish enough to venture down from O'Ghomoro were slaughtered and beheaded─their skulls put on display as a warning to others."
2162716,Tidegate,"Taking advantage of the chaos left in the Calamity's wake, a large force of Sahagin rose from the seas and laid claim to Halfstone, a distant Lominsan settlement on the far-western edge of La Noscea. To prevent any further swells of the beastman forces, a massive wall was erected between the enemy-occupied lowlands and the allied Skull Valley."
2162717,Camp Bronze Lake,"The formation of great underwater fissures during the Calamity saw nearly half of the water comprising Bronze Lake vanish in the span of a single night. The result was the uncovering of ancient Nymian ruins submerged for thousands of years─most notably, the Wanderer's Palace, a temple dedicated to the god Oschon."
2162718,Thalaos,"Though there is no proof to support the claim, rumor has these sun-bleached remains of a long-dead denizen of the deep are those of one of the legendary twin sea serpents believed to have been unleashed by the Navigator, Llymlaen, at the dawn of eras to fill the empty seas (the other being Perykos)."
2162719,Jijiroon's Trading Post,"Located on the eastern banks of Bronze Lake, Jijiroon's Trading Post is one of two makeshift markets peddling baubles and trinkets to those brave enough to venture that deep into kobold lands. The other is Memeroon's Trading Post, run by Jijiroon's estranged sibling, to whom the stubborn Qiqirn merchant hasn't spoken in twenty summers."
2162720,The Floating City of Nym,Suspended high above the foothills of Mt. O'Ghomoro is the Floating City of Nym─central hub of a lost civilization which prospered on Vylbrand during the Fifth Astral Era. The accepted theory as to how the city was torn from the realm involves the over-aspecting of corrupted wind crystals─a phenomenon witnessed late in the Sixth Astral Era.
2162721,Camp Overlook,"Manned by the “meanest shite-kickin' unit in the whole damn Maelstrom,” Camp Overlook serves as the base of operations for the Red Swallows─a privateer levy tasked with the surveillance of kobold activity in outer La Noscea and along the slopes of Mt. O'Ghomoro. "
2162722,U'Ghamaro Mines,"The brilliant rainbow-colored hues that permeate the otherwise bistre slopes of O'Ghomoro are a result of the endless flow of toxic slumgullion streaming forth from the labyrinthine warrens that make up U'Ghamaro Mines. As more kobolds arrive on the surface each day, there is a scramble to construct new forges to accommodate them."
2162723,The Hermit's Hovel,"While few have ever seen the lord of this humble hideaway which rests precariously on the edge of an unscalable precipice─let alone obtained his permission for entering the premises─that has not stopped travelers from taking full advantage of the respite the location offers, whether it be a dip in the steaming pools, or a few bells' slumber on the soft goosefeather bed."
2162724,The Carline Canopy,"Nestled cozily within the inn known as the Roost lies the relaxing Carline Canopy, a haven for those seeking a respite from travel's travails or questing's quandaries. Figaga's Gift, the towering waterwheel found outside the café, powers the saws and lathes of the Carpenters' Guild, and is widely considered Gridania's grandest architectural achievement."
2162725,The Lancers' Guild,"Founded by legendary Wood Wailer captain Mistalle, the Lancers' Guild doubles as a headquarters for those who keep the peace within Gridania, and the greater peace without. It is to these “Wailing Barracks” that people come with matters whose resolution requires a polearm's edge, and justice meted out to those who have wronged the forest or forestborn."
2162726,The Bannock,"Built around the stump of a fallen heavenspillar, the Bannock serves as training grounds for Order of the Twin Adder initiates. There are several theories regarding the origin of the area's name, some claiming it is taken from the hardtack issued to Grand Company recruits, others that it is derived from the training stump's resemblance to those selfsame rations."
2162727,Haukke Manor,"Long frowned upon by the people of Gridania as a symbol of excess, the Seedseers would finally submit to pressure from the citizenry, selling the deed to the manor to Lady Amandine of House Dartancours. The word “Haukke” is of ancient Padjali origin and means, “to speak without words.”"
2162728,The Guardian Tree,"Having seen over a thousand summers, the Guardian Tree is purportedly the oldest arbor in all the Black Shroud, and home to the great one─an elder elemental who watches and presides over the forest's denizens. The fruit borne by the tree resembles a plum and is sought after across the Three Great Continents for its curative properties."
2162729,Rainbow Bridge,"When struck by the rare sunbeams which happen to penetrate the thick canopy of the Black Shroud, the veil of fine mist created by one of the East Vein's myriad cataracts projects a brilliant rainbow which appears to connect the river's east and west banks. The grotto hidden behind the veil houses one of the forest's most sacred locations─Lifemend Stump."
2162730,The Seedbed,"Illuminated in the soft glow of countless moonspores, the Seedbed is an ancient arbor-turned-nursery used by the sylphs to grow and incubate their offspring, also known as podlings."
2162731,Buscarron's Druthers,"The Druthers is run by a disenfranchised ex-sentry-turned-tavernkeep and welcomes all manner of folk, from upstanding to unsavory, so long as they follow Buscarron Strongarm's simple rules of etiquette: sit down, forget your worries, and savor your ale."
2162732,South Shroud Landing,"Constructed by Highwind Skyways to serve as a landing for cargo airships, this location was quickly abandoned when the imperial presence in the area became too large to ignore. Now the site is used as a makeshift market where bandits and poachers peddle their ill-gotten wares far from the eyes of the law."
2162733,Urth's Gift,"Ancient writings tell that in exchange for her lifeblood, Lady Urth was able to seal the Dark Divinity Odin in a crystalline prison beneath a bubbling wellspring. To honor her sacrifice, the land upon which she drew her last breath still bears her name."
2162734,Quarrymill,"Once a deal had been struck between the Gelmorrans and the elementals allowing their return to the forest surface, the Elezen began unearthing large quantities of boulders to build the foundations of their new city, Gridania. The waterwheels of Quarrymill were raised to power the hammers which rendered the massive stones into workable blocks."
2162735,Ixali Logging Grounds,"The Ixal have never taken well their banishment from the Black Shroud, and to this day continue to fell the hoary sentinels growing on the forest's outskirts. Too heavy to drag back to their settlements in Natalan or faraway Xelphatol, the ill-gotten lumber is tied to balloons buoyed with Ixali airstones and flown to the beast tribe's homeland under the cover of night."
2162736,Fallen Neurolink,"Coined by the learned men of Garlond Ironworks, these massive rings were used to dampen spiritual energies, preventing the focusing of power required to wield magicks. No less than five, each measuring hundreds of yalms across, were required to keep Bahamut silent for three full eras...but even then they proved insufficient."
2162737,Alder Springs,"Once a vast grove of giant alders, the flames of the Calamity reduced the area to a charred graveyard, leaving nothing of the ancient holt but its name."
2162738,Castrum Marinum,"Situated atop the roiling Rhotano Sea between Aldenard and the eastern coast of Vylbrand, Castrum Marinum serves as the southernmost outpost for the Garlean Empire's XIVth Legion. The cohort stationed on this man-made floating island is primarily tasked with the resupplying of imperial army cohorts deployed in the La Noscea and Thanalan theaters. "
2162739,Vesper Bay,"A bustling port city strategically situated on the western coast of Thanalan and maintained using funds generously provided by Syndicate chairman Lolorito, Vesper Bay serves as a gateway in and out of sultanate-controlled lands. The colossal bronze statue in the main plaza is said to be an exact likeness of said chairman (when viewed from afar)."
2162740,Black Brush Station,"A marvel of modern innovation, the steam engine has transformed the mining industry, increasing efficiency and profits thrice over. It has also led to the transformation of what was once a thinly manned aetheryte outpost into a thriving crossroads of labor and commerce─a new pillar to support the thriving Ul'dahn economy."
2162741,Gate of Nald,"One of three main portals accessible by the general populace, the Gate of Nald is wide enough for two fully burdened chocobo carriages to enter abreast and still leave room for the flanking gateguards. Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo has commanded that the portcullis remain open night and day, so as to welcome all who would partake of Ul'dah's wonders."
2162742,The Burning Wall,"Once an unscalable precipice severing eastern Thanalan from the Grand Wake, the Burning Wall earned its name for the deep-red glow it would emit each evening as the sun set. Toppled by the Calamity, that cliff no longer exists─in its place a queer forest of crystalline sentinels and malformed creatures shunned by nature itself."
2162743,The Golden Bazaar,"Once a waypoint for traders making the journey between Gridania and Ul'dah, the rise of settlements such as Camp Drybone and Highbridge have all but rendered the once prospering hamlet a ghost town. Rumors of mythril deposits in the nearby mountains and treasure in the ruins of the Invisible City, however, may work to rekindle this dying ember."
2162744,Thal's Respite,"Overseer of wealth in the afterlife, proper obeisance to the Trader Thal is required for those who wish to take belongings accumulated in this world to the hereafter. Thal's Respite is oft used by stout devotees of the Order of Nald'thal as a place of fasting and prayer, but its distance from Ul'dah prevents all but the most affluent from making the journey."
2162745,Nald's Reflection,"Overseer of wealth and commerce upon the corporeal plane, it is believed that through fervent worship of the Trader Nald, one will reap immeasurable fortune in one's living years. Prince and pauper alike once made pilgrimages to this remote place of prayer in search of prosperity...until, that is, Milvaneth Sacrarium opened a new (toll-based) temple within Ul'dah."
2162746,Zahar'ak,"Loosely translated as “land of perseverance,” Zahar'ak is a forward stronghold for the Amalj'aa host based in Zanr'ak. The beast tribe believes the scorched plains of Thanalan to be hallowed ground blessed by the cleansing flames of their primal deity, Ifrit, and as such are intent on driving from the land all whom they deem invaders."
2162747,The Sagolii Desert,"According to the Sons of Saint Coinach, the Sagolii Desert was once a verdant sea of lush plains capable of sustaining great civilizations, as is evidenced by the ruins recently discovered in the area. How such a place devolved into a lifeless desert remains a mystery, but recent disaster tells us an ancient calamity is the likely culprit."
2162748,The Sunken Temple of Qarn,"Most scholars of ancient Belah'dian civilization claim this twisting labyrinth of complex chambers to be a place of worship dedicated to the sun goddess, Azeyma. Recent diggings, however, have uncovered older chambers buried beneath the new containing relics not of the Sixth Astral Era, suggesting that the temple may have been built by a different people."
2162749,Minotaur Malm,"Local legend has that long ago, a young goatherd leading his pack to water at Forgotten Springs was set upon and chased a full malm through these caves by a minotaur. There has yet to be a second sighting of the creature, but the stories are enough to frighten away most who would consider passage through this trading post used by the Seventy-Seven Caravans."
2162750,East Watchtower,"To power their legions of warmachina, the Garleans require a steady supply of the aether-based fuel known as ceruleum. Bluefog housing the largest deposit in Eorzea, the Empire has begun their own mining operation but a stone's throw from the Allied refineries, heightening tensions in the area and prompting the construction of two watchtowers."
2162751,Ceruleum Pipeline,"Even before airships and engines were commonplace in Eorzea, Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern recognized the potential value of ceruleum and laid claim to nearly all of the untapped deposits in northern Thanalan. In an ironic twist, for many years before the Garlean invasion, the Concern's biggest customer was, in fact, the imperial army."
2162752,Bluefog,"Though abundant on the northern continent of Ilsabard, only a handful of ceruleum deposits have ever been discovered on Aldenard, the largest being buried under the Sea of Spires in northern Thanalan. Ceruleum is a highly unstable substance and will begin to evaporate when in contact with air, resulting in the bluish haze from which this area earns its name."
2162753,Raubahn's Push,"In the final days of the Sixth Astral Era, the ceruleum fields of northern Thanalan proved to be one of the most hotly contested areas in all Eorzea, with the Empire amassing a giant host outside of Bluefog to seize control of the local fuel refineries. Though outnumbered three to one, Raubahn and his army succeeded in “pushing” back the enemy."
2162754,Abandoned Amajina Mythril Mine,"The discovery of mythril in a small copper mine in Bluefog triggered the Great Rush which saw would-be prospectors flock to the Sea of Spires in search of quick and easy fortune. The veins that ran through the mountains, however, were not deep, and it was but ten summers before the mines ceased to yield the precious metal, forcing many to abandon their claims. "
2162755,The Nail,"As is described in the <hex:021A020203>Enchiridion<hex:021A020103>, to ensure the realm of man did not drift apart from the firmament, Halone struck the Nail through both, ever binding the two. And though assailed on all sides by great metal shards fallen from the lesser moon Dalamud's crust, the ancient peak remained standing, a testament to the land's life force."
2162756,The Observatorium,"Three hundred years ago, Ishgardian astrologian Adaunel the Younger convinced the Holy See that he could predict the comings and goings of the Dravanian Horde by studying the movements of the heavens, and thus secured funding for the construction of the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena and its grand astroscope."
2162757,The Frozen Fang,"In years past, the hot alpine summers would have seen this fallen Dravanian outflyer blown with maggots and reduced to bones in a matter of days. Now, in the endless winter wrought by the Calamity, the carcass rests in the permafrost under a thick blanket of snow, perfectly preserved since the day he was pierced through the heart by a ballista."
2162758,The Holy See of Ishgard,"For the past thousand years, Ishgard has waged a bloody war with the dragons of Dravania. To fend off the enemy horde, a complex web of defenses, magical and corporeal, has been added piecemeal to the city proper's outer walls, transforming her into an impenetrable bastion, while at the same time, isolating her and her people from the outside world."
2162759,Boulder Downs,"Before the Calamity, Boulder Downs was a vast sloped lea littered with moraine deposited by realm-swallowing glaciers long receded. The rain of debris that accompanied the fall of Dalamud, however, transformed the landscape into a frozen wasteland pocked with gaping impact craters and peculiar dark matter formations."
2162760,The Fury's Gaze,"A place holy to all Ishgardians, it is believed that when a man stands within this hidden grotto, the Fury Herself will reach deep into the darkest recesses of his soul and lay out his sins before him, allowing the man to repent those failings. Monument Tower was built nearby to protect this hallowed ground from the taint of dragons and heretics."
2162761,Snowcloak,"The bitter cold which swept over the Coerthas highlands following the Calamity did not only blanket the region in snow and ice, but transformed the water of Twinpools and the Swiftrun into a mountainous flow of ice─a flow which has slowly crept through the western Coerthas highlands and now has completely engulfed Gargoyle Crossing, preventing passage."
2162762,Camp Dragonhead,"Its name taken from a rocky outcropping said to be the head of a Dravanian king turned to stone by the almighty hand of Halone, this outpost acts as the Coerthas central highlands' southernmost line of defense for the Holy See, tasked with fending off Ixali raids from Natalan, skirmishes by heretic factions, and the occasional yeti scare."
2162763,The Steel Vigil,"One of four citadel watchtowers built along the Sea of Clouds, the Steel Vigil warned the Holy See of aerial attacks for centuries before being razed and gutted by the Dravanian Horde and their vile commander, Svara. Now, only the outer walls remain, leaving a bitter reminder of the dragons' destructive power."
2162764,Castrum Centri,"Castrum Centri was erected with material salvaged from the ruins of Castrum Novum─the Garlean Empire's first major outpost in Eorzea, constructed in the final year of the Sixth Astral Era by VIIth Legion legatus Nael van Darnus. It houses several ceruleum mining pits, a magitek manufactory, and the Phantom Train, used to transport ordnance to outlying castra."
2162765,The Crystal Tower,"As if somehow beckoned forth from its hypogeal prison by the events of the Calamity, this sky-scraping spire now commands the Mor Dhonan horizon. Through their research, the Sons of Saint Coinach have determined that the monolith, also known as Syrcus Tower, was constructed to collect and store the endless energies of the sun."
2162766,Rathefrost,"The fall of the <hex:021A020203>Agrius<hex:021A020103> into Silvertear Falls not only drained the magnificent multi-tiered lake, but instantly crystallized the majority of the region's flora─a result of mass quantities of ceruleum fuel reacting with aether released upon Midgardsormr's death. What remains is a brilliant-yet-dead landscape akin to a twisted garden pocked with blooming geodes."
2162767,The Keeper of the Lake,"Maintaining a silent vigil over Silvertear Lake, the Keeper is wrought from the wreckage of the imperial flagship, the <hex:021A020203>Agrius<hex:021A020103>, and the entangled remains of Midgardsormr. For many religious and mythological enthusiasts, it stands as proof of the existence of the gods. For most people, however, it serves as a grim reminder of the horrific power of Garlemald."
2162768,Falcon's Nest,"From its humble origins as a lonely cluster of barracks nestled in the mountains of western Coerthas, the village of Falcon's Nest grew and prospered until the Calamity came and the icy winter took its deathly toll. Its name derives from the falconers who reside there with their snow white charges, defending their mountain home from the Dravanian threat."
2162769,Camp Riversmeet,"Once a key military outpost for the Ishgardian forces, this strategic location where the waters of the Swiftrun and the Coerthas flow together is home to a lone aetheryte shard, which has stood abandoned in the years since the Calamity."
2162770,The Dreaming Dragon,"What appears to be an island floating amidst the icy waters of Ashpool is said to have once been a living, breathing dragon─magicked into slumber by the Holy See until ash enveloped its body and its limbs turned nigh unto stone."
2162771,The Dusk Vigil,"The Calamity was not kind to this once-proud watchtower, from which Ser Yuhelmeric and the brave knights of House Durendaire once stood watch against the encroaching Horde. Since the walls fell and the chill took hold, it has come to be inhabited by all manner of fell beasts, and gods only know what else."
2162772,Gorgagne Mills,"Ser Gorgagne was a proud knight and bannerman of House Durendaire, until the fateful day when the heir of that house vanished from sight while under his care, never to be seen again. Devastated by the loss of the boy and his own failing, he put aside his blade and built this farm, where he quietly lived out the rest of his days."
2162773,Hemlock,"Once a bustling village and home to the woodcutters who plied their trade in the western highlands of Coerthas, this settlement─named for the large evergreens unique to the area─was abandoned when the chill came, and remains a ghost town to this day."
2162774,The Bed of Bones,"It remains to be confirmed whether, as the tales say, yetis prefer to slumber atop makeshift bedding fashioned from the remains of their victims─in large part because prominent naturalists have been reluctant to do the fieldwork necessary to corroborate this claim. "
2162775,Loth ast Gnath,"Built from a highly viscous blend of Dravanian clay and saliva, the nests of the Gnath are surprisingly stable, able to withstand the harsh elements of the Dravanian forelands. The smoke that rises from the mound-like structures is believed to be a sort of incense with a scent that, for reasons unknown, keeps would-be dragon invaders at bay."
2162776,Anyx Minor,"The shattered ruins of a once-proud city. The official stance of the Holy See is that it was a settlement of heretics, razed to the ground by Halone in an act of divine retribution, though scholars disagree on the historical accuracy of this interpretation."
2162777,Anyx Trine,"Three towers unique in that they appear to have been built to house both man and dragon, an architectural oddity which would seem to corroborate the Holy See's position that they were erected by heretic witches for themselves and their dragon consorts."
2162778,The Hundred Throes,"The rushing river has all but swallowed these ancient ruins at the base of Sohm Al, which now serve as a nest to all manner of beastkin who find sustenance in its waters, and the dragons who find sustenance in said beastkin."
2162779,Halo,"This ancient altar sits in the fiery depths of Mourn. Once adorned by statues depicting a girl and a dragon, only the latter has survived to the present age. Lift your eyes above the structure, and the base of the floating peak of Sohm Al can be seen."
2162780,Tailfeather,"Founded by hunters who came to the frontiers in hopes of snaring the wild chocobos of the forest, this settlement and those who call it home are shielded from the eyes of the dragons by the canopy of the majestic caelumtrees that rise high above it."
2162781,Sohm Al,"Of all the mighty peaks that comprise Abalathia's Spine, none rise higher than Sohm Al, the highest point in all Eorzea. It is held as a sacred land by the dragons, who are said to journey here when they feel their life slipping away. Formed not of stone but solid crystal, the massive mountain floating above the ground below is a marvelous sight to behold."
2162782,Moghome,"A settlement that sits curiously atop Sohm Al, the tallest peak in Eorzea, in the heart of the dragons' demesne. What pact might the moogles have made with the great wyrm Hraesvelgr to allow them to live here in peace?"
2162783,The Aery,"Vicious aetheric storms rage in Nidhogg's lair, keeping out all those who would dare disturb the great wyrm in his slumber─be it one of years or centuries."
2162784,Tharl Oom Khash,"An ancient structure half-consumed by crystal, its name means “crystal from remorse” in the tongue of dragons. From the sheer mass of crystallization, it has been posited that an entity possessed of aetheric power to rival the seven great wyrms laid down its life here..."
2162785,Zenith,"A majestic fortress in Hraesvelgr's domain, watched over at the great wyrm's behest by the moogles who make their home in the Churning Mists. Though the years─a thousand of them─have taken their toll, it still stands proud and strong, stirring the hearts of all who lay eyes upon it."
2162786,The Lost Landlord,"This colossus stands on an island in Greensward. Its name was bestowed by the moogles, who believe it to be a statue of the “king of the land-dwellers,” though no records remain that could shed light on the identity of this individual, and whether or not he ever truly walked the realm."
2162787,The House of Letters,"The thousand-year-old ruins of a tower said to have been built by the hand of man and dragon in the days before the war. Even now, as it lies crumbling in ruin, one can still make out the letters engraved in its walls, which have led the moogles to give it the name by which it is now commonly known."
2162788,The Rookery,"As the moogles tell it, the place known as the Rookery was once a bustling skyport where wayfarers came and went on the backs of trained wyverns. These days, the buildings remain, but the only dragons in sight are the vicious minions of Nidhogg."
2162789,Camp Cloudtop,"An outpost manned by the Rose Knights of House Haillenarte, who stand watch against Dravanian incursions from atop the floating islets in the sky. Boasts the <hex:021A020203>Protector<hex:021A020103>, a mighty airship that would avail the Ishgardians greatly in their battle against the Horde were it ever repaired to full strength."
2162790,The Nidifice,"A nest of great migratory birds that travel with the seasons from the Near East to Eorzea and back again in search of warmer climes. It is here that they lay their eggs, raise their young, and teach them to take to the skies before making the journey anew."
2162791,Voor Sian Siran,"A spring formed from moisture in the atmosphere accumulated and solidified by the power of water crystals. It is said that the knight who first discovered these ethereal waters shared the story with a wandering minstrel, who declared it to be the legendary paradise of Voor Sian Siran. However, this claim has been met with some skepticism, given the minstrel's penchant for embellishment."
2162792,Mok Oogl Island,"An island whose name, in the tongue of the Vanu Vanu, translates to “a noise heard on high.” On the island stands a monument engraved with a mark of moogle design, but no sign of the creatures themselves, leaving its origins clouded in mystery."
2162793,Hall of the Fallen Plume,"Among the most sacred locations of the Vanu Vanu, this is said to be the spot where a single feather from Bismarck, ruler of the clouds, fell to the surface. In recent years, the elder of the violent Vundu tribe has claimed it as his seat of power, from which he rules with an iron claw."
2162794,Ok' Vundu Vana,"Roughly translating as “high home of the Vundu,” this village is home to the Vanu Vanu's aggressive Vundu tribe. Exceedingly proud, the Vundu believe that the voices of those who live highest in the skies will be heard loud and clear by the ruler of the clouds."
2162795,Hengr's Crucible,"This oddly shaped isle, floating in the eastern reaches of the Sea of Clouds, is named for the witch Hengr, a figure of Coerthan faerie tales whose cauldron its shape is said to resemble. In recent years, it has become a gathering place for the notoriously territorial toco tocos."
2162796,The Arkhitekton,"Once home to Sharlayan masters who fashioned aetherytes within its halls, this workshop is now home to the Illuminati, a nasty band of goblins who would wield the ancient technologies within for their own nefarious ends."
2162797,The Answering Quarter,"This Sharlayan settlement stretches across the western banks of the Thaliak. Home to Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and a center for education and scholarly pursuits, it hearkens back to the cities of learning that flourished in bygone times."
2162798,The Cenotaph,"A towering monolith erected in tribute to the great scholars who have passed on, leaving behind the knowledge that has shaped the realm. The names of countless men of learning are etched in the mighty stone, along with the motto of Sharlayan: “Knowledge Seeks No Man.”"
2162799,The Tipped Ewer,"The spot where the melted snows of Abalathia's Spine flow emerge from their source to descend down the mountain, forming the countless tributaries that come together as the mighty Thaliak River. The name is said to come from the deity whose name the river bears and the magicked pitcher from which poured the waters of knowledge."
2162800,Great Gubal Library,"A massive library constructed by the Sharlayans to house the wealth of knowledge they had amassed in their travels across the realm. Though the vast majority of the tomes that once lined its shelves were carried back to the motherland in the exodus, it is said forbidden texts still slumber in sealed-off vaults below."
2162801,The Orn Wild,"A primeval forest that stretches across the northern reaches of the Dravanian hinterlands, its rich verdure sustained by the pristine waters of the Thaliak. Nigh untouched by the hand of man, its wilds stand between those who would make their way to Sharlayan without braving a trek across the forelands."
2162802,Saint Mocianne's Arboretum,"This botanical garden built by the Sharlayans once was home to fauna and flora collected from across the realm, the study of which yielded numerous discoveries regarding our natural world. Sadly, it was abandoned in the exodus, the teeming life within left to run wild and unchecked."
2162803,The <hex:021A020203>Gration<hex:021A020103>,"Flagship of the VIth Legion of the Garlean Empire, of the same make as the fallen <hex:021A020203>Agrius<hex:021A020103>. It now lies grounded, its ceruleum engines sealed in aetheric ice by the hand of Shiva, Lady of Frost."
2162804,The Fractal Continuum,"A mighty warship converted to a museum, intended to preserve for eternity precious artifacts from the thousand-year history of the Allagan Empire. From everyday tools to advanced military technology, the objects within are a testament to the fallen civilization's surpassing might and prosperity."
2162805,Antithesis,"Home to Tiamat, great wyrm of Midgardsormr's first brood, who fell to and was imprisoned by the Allagans. Even now, she laments her fateful decision to summon her brood-brother Bahamut back as a primal to aid her in her struggle."
2162806,Aetherochemical Research Facility,"An ancient Allagan research facility, wherein studies in restraining dragons and mastering primals were conducted. Test subjects from failed experiments prowl its long-since-abandoned halls."
2162807,Helix,"A massive port of sorts that stands among the wastes of Azys Lla. As the guidance node tells it, it was one of the few imperial landings massive enough to house Ragnarok-class internment hulks. It would seem the docking rings that remain are but a fraction of those that stood in bygone days."
2162808,Quarantine Block,This floating islet in a lonely corner of Azys Lla served as an isolation area for chimerical creations which failed to meet established safety parameters. Historical records indicate that the facility began its life as a research center for advanced agricultural crossbreeding.
2162809,Recombination Labs,"This Allagan research facility gave birth to countless numbers of chimerical creations. Though the guidance system is quick to assure all visitors that the good behavior of the creatures born here was─at least at one point─guaranteed, recent visitors may find themselves having doubts."
2162810,The Pike,"A monumental stone sculpture carved in the likeness of Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon. The stonemason Percelle devoted thirty of her later years chiseling the piece, and it has stood for more than 150 years since. Even today, one cannot find a more stirring tribute to one of Ishgard's founding fathers."
2162811,Black Iron Bridge,"This testament to the skill of House Dzemael's artisans serves the main road stretching from the capital to the Dusk Vigil. Although built primarily of solid stone, the bridge was named for its suspended metal chains, wrought from black iron impervious to the blazing temperatures of a dragon's exhalation."
2162812,Dragonspit,"Said to be as scalding as a wyrm's breath, Dragonspit is a colorful analogy for the hot springs nestled between the cliffs near the Slate Mountains. Local wildlife has long been attracted to the warmth of the natural thermal pools, and their numbers have only increased following the advent of the long winter. The steaming springs are also frequented by Ishgardian knights, who laud them for their supposed healing properties.  "
2162813,The Slate Mountains,"These mountains on the outskirts of Ishgard were valued as a mining site for slate of exceptional quality. Three years past, the knights of House Dzemael attempted to carve an Ishgardian stronghold into the cliffs, enraging the dragon Cuelebre and his followers. Remnants of the gruesome battle that followed still lie scattered about the crags, unable to decay in the chilled altitude."
2162814,Whilom River,"When asked to explain the origin of its name, the local hunters usually say that while the river courses with tranquility in the present day, it once ran scarlet with the blood of the Dravanians and their foes. Those who fraternize with the dragons refute this interpretation, asserting instead that the river is symbolic of the passage of time since the sorrowful parting of paths between man and dragon.   "
2162815,Loth ast Vath,"Cast out from the main colony, a minority of Gnath known as the Nonmind built Loth ast Vath as a sanctuary for other exiles. The word “Vath” is derogatory in the Gnathic tongue, referring to those who can no longer link their thoughts to the Overmind. Possessed of individual personalities unlike their Onemind brothers, the Vath learn to live with each other's differing thoughts in the makeshift colony."
2162816,The Hissing Cobbles,"The remaining fragment of a forgotten highway, the Hissing Cobbles have been molded by the inexorable march of time, its neatly arranged grids of stone fading into earth and dust. The hunters of Tailfeather bitterly call it such as many a tracked quarry have escaped, startled by the hissing sound of boots grating on loose gravel."
2162817,The Danneroad ,"This road leading to Anyx Trine was originally called Dran Errn, which roughly translates to “the path of dragon and man.” Due to the difficult pronunciation, the road became known as the Danneroad over time, and its profound meaning was forgotten by all but the Dravanians."
2162818,Statue of the Unsung,"A solitary statue of a dragon in the southeastern corner of the Churning Mists. While it is difficult to ascertain the circumstances which led to its creation, the sculpture's foundation bears a weathered inscription in an early script which reads “along with the memory of thine heroic sapphire wings.”"
2162819,Landlord Colony,"The many dwellings here show evidence of extensive damage, likely the work of a furious Nidhogg following the betrayal of man. The moogles tell that the ruins were once home to the “lords of the lower lands,” although their history was lost in the great wyrm's wrath."
2162820,The Old Father,The moogles consider this ancient tree to be the forebearer of all flora in the Churning Mists. They believe that the Father bore witness to a time before man and dragon descended into their millennium of bloodshed. 
2162821,Coldwind,"When the Rose Knights first came to the Sea of Clouds and treated with the Zundu, they asked the chieftain what he called this islet floating northwest of Ok' Zundu, to which he responded “small island beneath which cold winds of Coerthas ever blow.” For the sake of brevity, the knights simply called it Coldwind."
2162822,The Shattered Back,The strong seasonal winds from the north have carved the crags of this floating isle into their unique shapes. The knights of Ishgard called it the Shattered Back for its ominous resemblance to the gnarled rib bones of a great beast.
2162823,Provenance,"When Ser Marielle was appointed to the Rose Knights of Camp Cloudtop, she spotted this heart-shaped island atop the deck of her airship bound for post. It reminded the knight of a place of provenance where two lovers would begin their journey together, and the island was named thus."
2162824,The Sage's Cataract,"As the Thaliak River stretches north towards the Orn Wild, it spills over this grand waterfall. In the past, students would compete to see who could swim closest to the cataract's edge without succumbing to its powerful torrents. A ban on entering the waters was eventually imposed after too many accidents."
2162825,The Path of Knowing,"This colossal bridge was once a bustling artery for researchers, students, and curators commuting to and from the Great Gubal Library. Its stone pillars suffered significant damage when the Calamity reshaped the land, causing a portion of the walkway to crumble and collapse."
2162826,The Daggers,"An area of the hinterlands where clusters of stone columns shaped like daggers protrude from the earth. The scholars of Sharlayan had long been engulfed in a heated debate over whether the name was too simple and colloquial, but a different one was never decided upon as the proposals began to exceed the columns in number."
2162827,Centrifugal Crystal Engine,This seemingly indefatigable engine harnessed the power of the imprisoned Warring Triad to transmute the life force of chimera experiments into synthetic crystal. These manufactured shards would then be used to fuel the cultivation of the chimeras as part of research into the possibility of obtaining limitless power. 
2162828,Biomass Incubation Complex,"A research facility dedicated to chimera splicing experiments. Its construction was prompted by “imaginative requests” from the Allagan Research Council and related institutes, leading to the cultivation of all manner of living prototypes. The Mutagenesis nearby serves as an annex to the complex."
2162829,The Cathedral,"A cathedral designed in a distinct Meracydian style.  The architecture suggests a place of worship by a tribe of treelike beings who believed themselves “remnants” of Sephirot. To research the link between faith and primal summoning, the Allagans moved the ancient structure to Azys Lla from its original location on the southern continent."
2162830,Castellum Velodyna,"Built upon the bridge over the Velodyna River, this imperial fortification serves as a critical waypoint for supplies, connecting the many military installations to the east with Baelsar's Wall to the west. Rising sky-high from the center is a great tower that provides moorage for airships."
2162831,Gyr Kehim,"A monastery established some three centuries ago by Heimart, high priest of the Fist of Rhalgr. In the ancient Mhachi language, the name means “one's mirage”─a reference to the arduous training that monks underwent to face their inner self in their quest to master both body and mind."
2162832,Schism,"In a time out of mind, seeking to approach the sublimity of Rhalgr, a man began pummeling a mountain with his fists. After decades of nigh ceaseless striking, he succeeded in forming a great cavern in the mountain. This nameless soul is revered as the first monk of the Fist of Rhalgr, and the temple was later built here, within the hollow he had created."
2162833,Castrum Oriens,"This Garlean stronghold has its beginnings as the construction base for Baelsar's Wall. Following the Seventh Umbral Calamity, it was expanded to become a fully fledged castrum for the Black Wolf's renewed invasion efforts. Nowadays, it is held by the Order of the Twin Adder and jointly garrisoned by Alliance forces."
2162834,Dimwold,"A gloomy forest occupying the southern expanse of East End. Drenched by the waters of Timmon Beck and numerous subterranean springs, the air beneath the boughs is laden with moisture, giving rise to a constant veil of light-smothering mist."
2162835,Djanan Qhat,"A distinctive castle of clay built by the Ananta, housing within its depths a shrine to the goddess Lakshmi, Lady of Bliss. For this reason it was given its name, which means “mother's bed” in the Ananta tongue. At present it is occupied by the dominant Qalyana tribe."
2162836,The Peering Stones,"The village of the M tribe, perched high atop a crag. Its position affords residents a commanding view of their entire territory, and neither trespasser nor prey may pass through unnoticed. As the Garleans deem hunting cultures savage, however, imperial rule has proven harder upon them than most."
2162837,Hidden Tear,"A shrine for honoring the departed, backed by a waterfall whose constant roaring muffles one's sobs and whose spraying hides one's tears. Under imperial rule, however, religious rites were outlawed, and for a long time people could not hold even the simplest services to remember loved ones."
2162838,Coldhearth,"Tucked away in a forgotten corner of the Peaks, this sleepy hamlet is known for producing mercenaries, a tradition that was born out of necessity. With its lands yielding precious little bounty, youths took to leaving hearth and home behind to trade their sword arms for coin, most notable among them being Raubahn Aldynn, the Bull of Ala Mhigo."
2162839,<hex:021A020203>Nyunkrepf's Hope<hex:021A020103>,"When the Sixth Umbral Calamity befell Eorzea and the realm was transformed into a sea, this great vessel, built by a man hailing far from the north named Nyunkrepf, saved full many lives. Having taken aboard countless souls drifting in the floodwaters, it was finally transported by magicks to its current resting place."
2162840,Ala Gannha,"Situated in the Peak's northern reaches, this village once flourished through its quarry, the beautiful stone sourced and cut here used to build no lesser a structure than the Royal Palace of Ala Mhigo. Such prosperous days, however, have become but a memory, and the villagers are faced with the harsh realities of a failing industry."
2162841,Specula Imperatoris,"After claiming Gyr Abania for its own, the Empire erected this monstrous tower in order to maintain watch over the region. A communications spire was later added in preparation for the next phase of the Eorzean invasion, followed by an energy spire for activating the Ultima Weapon."
2162842,The Arms of Meed,"Cleanse your mind, hone your flesh, redeem your soul─so teaches the Fist of Rhalgr. The temple was built in accordance with this belief, that those who have committed wrongs might atone for their sins. Seven years of grueling training here will earn you the Destroyer's forgiveness no matter the weight of your crime."
2162843,The Ziggurat,"The Sixth Umbral Calamity wreaked havoc upon the realm's aetherial flow, giving rise to unstable weather patterns. Desiring to correct the disturbance, descendants of the Amdapori and the Mhachi set aside past differences and came together to build the Ziggurat, which served as a weight to still the land's writhing currents of aether."
2162844,Emprise,"In the past, monks who completed their training at the Temple of the Fist were honored in a ceremony held in this hallowed cloister. Once alive with activity, thronging with monks and pilgrims alike, it was laid to waste at the mad king's command and is now home to naught but ghosts of the past."
2162845,Ala Mhigo,"Having conquered all the lands of Gyr Abania, King Anshelm ordered the construction of a fortress city that would serve to repel invaders from Ilsabard. Completed in the year 1135 of the Sixth Astral Era, it stood as a symbol of defiance until it fell to the Empire, whereupon it became a symbol of oppression."
2162846,The Ala Mhigan Quarter,"A residential area situated to the south of Ala Mhigo, built to accommodate the city's growing population. As the newest district to be added, it is a considerable distance from the Royal Palace, and was expected to become an enclave for the less well-to-do. Under Garlean rule, it more or less retained that status, serving to quarter the Aan─those without citizenship."
2162847,Sothwatch,"A watchtower erected to guard against invaders that may emerge from the cloudy expanses to the south. In the event of a threat, a flaming arrow is loosed from the top to alert those in the city. The Garleans saw no use for it, however, and it has stood empty in the years following Ala Mhigo's fall."
2162848,The Divine Audience,"A magnificent altar fashioned in the form of a stairway extending high above Loch Seld, at the top of which worshipers may come face–to–face with the statue of the Destroyer. Formerly a place of piety, it earned a bloody reputation when the mad king Theodoric took to using it as an execution site."
2162849,The Hidden Tunnel,"In order to supply Ala Mhigo with potable water, brine was channeled from Loch Seld to be distilled. With the Empire's arrival, however, existing techniques were replaced with magitek-based filtration systems, and the well was rendered obsolete and abandoned."
2162850,Porta Praetoria,"Formerly a checkpoint along the main highroad to Ala Mhigo, it was incorporated into the newly constructed Castrum Abania. Prior to the Garlean invasion, the area bustled with merchants bound for the Near East, but mercantile endeavors have since given way to military ones."
2162851,The Sekiseigumi Barracks,"An unassuming space leading to the Sekiseigumi Barracks, the headquarters of Kugane's peacekeeping force. Off-duty Sekiseigumi members are often seen relaxing at the nearby teahouse, and if you tilt your head up, you can take in the unashamedly grandiose main gates of Kugane Castle."
2162852,Bokairo Inn,"An inn with sweeping ocean views, famed for the healing properties of its hot springs. The public baths of Hingashi are largely mixed gender, and it is customary to bathe naked. But in a trading hub such as Kugane, where folk of myriad cultures and creeds mingle, one is expected to don not one's nameday but bathing suit."
2162853,Kogane Dori,"Meaning “gold” in ancient Hingan, Kugane is a port where golden fortunes are made, and it is on this bustling street that merchants earn lesser fortunes, or “kogane.” From foreign wares to local specialties, there is something to suit every taste. Those who have had their fill of the markets may also find amusement at the renowned Mujikoza theater."
2162854,Kogane Alleyways,"This quiet canal-side lane offers a splendid view of the Tasogare Bridge, built in the distinctive arched style of the Far East. Just beyond lies Kugane Ofunakura, where vessels that sail the seas are made, above which rises the airship tower, where vessels that soar the skies are moored."
2162855,Shiokaze Hostelry,"A towering tavern─the largest in Kugane─favored by local merchants and dockworkers and foreign visitors alike. Guests can indulge in Far Eastern cuisine made with the freshest seafood while sipping on fine rice wine imported from Koshu, the main island of Hingashi."
2162856,Tamamizu,"An underwater village founded by the peaceful Kojin of the Blue. Though the Kojin are able to survive for long periods without air, they do not possess gills like the Sahagin. So it was that they developed magicks that allowed them to create an immense bubble of air within which to dwell."
2162857,Shoal Rock,"One of many isles that pepper the Ruby Sea, hemmed in to the north by a circular formation of enormous coral whereupon the Confederacy established an outpost. According to Hingan historians, the isle was formed of magma that spewed forth from Hells' Lid."
2162858,Heaven-on-High,"A slender tower of stone stacked to impossible heights, seemingly piercing the very heavens. Aside from a Far Eastern myth that attributes its creation to the kami, little is known about the structure. During a time of war, audacious pirates of the Confederacy made landfall and claimed the spot for their own."
2162859,Sakazuki,"Its name meaning “goblet,” this island is said to be the birthplace of the Confederacy, where rival pirates first toasted as brothers and pledged themselves to a common cause. Today it remains an important outpost, constantly garrisoned by sharp-eyed guards who keep watch for vessels that sail the Ruby Sea."
2162860,The Isle of Zekki,"So named as the home of a fearsome fiend, even the Kojin of the Red, who have long dwelled here, came to know the isle by this moniker. An island in truth in the distant past, it was joined to the mainland by magma over the course of multiple volcanic eruptions."
2162861,Isari,"A small fishing village situated on the eastern coastline of Othard, its name a reference to its livelihood. For a time the Confederacy had something of a presence here, operating out of a little shack and collecting its Ruby Tithe."
2162862,The Swallow's Compass,"Enshrined within this tomb, his likeness carved on an imposing scale into the cliffside, is the person of Ganen, the great general who united the warring clans of Yanxia to arise as the first king of Doma. A skilled swordsman and mage both, he is credited as the founding father of Doman geomancy."
2162863,Castrum Fluminis,"Established twenty-five years ago as an advance post for the invasion of Doma, the castrum served for a time afterwards as an administrative center for the imperial occupation. As repairs on Doma Castle progressed, its occupants relocated to the city, abandoning it to nature."
2162864,Namai,"A village situated amidst the mountains of the Gensui Chain, named for the local word for the aquatic arrowhead plant, an allusion to its long history in rice farming. The arrival of the Empire placed this lifestyle under siege, but through perseverance the villagers continue to hold on to their ways."
2162865,Prism Lake,"An enigmatic lake carved out in steps, whose waters have taken on the colors of the rainbow. Scholars attribute its beautiful coloration to the rich and exposed deposits of high-purity crystals in the area, while legend tells of an angelic being who fashioned a bridge of rainbow for her mortal lover."
2162866,Doma Castle,"The seat of power in the nation of Doma, whose dominion encompassed the entirety of Yanxia. The crag-top site was chosen in order to control the One River, an artery of trade and transport and a vital source of water in the region. Under imperial rule, it was made into a viceroyalty and its military capabilities were greatly expanded."
2162867,Dairyu Moon Gates,"Built into natural rock with openings fashioned in the shape of a full moon, this series of colossal portals regulate traffic upon the One River. The Empire, desiring to exert greater control, further added magitek field generators."
2162868,Yuzuka Manor,"For generations, the lords of the Yuzuka family faithfully served the Doman monarchy as governors of One River settlements, and this was their dwelling. Razed during the rebellion, a clan of Namazu has since taken up residence."
2162869,Ceol Aen,"A cluster of ancient stone pillars located near Bardam's Mettle, upon each of which the songs of the peoples of the Steppe are graven. Although the pillars' placement may appear haphazard, when the wind blows through them, they are said to come alive with melodies from ages past."
2162870,Dotharl Khaa,"In the language of the Steppe, “khaa” means a spring, and the Dotharl tribe has laid claim to this particular one. It is a rare oasis in the deathly dry climes of the Nhaama Desert, and travelers are strongly advised to replenish their water supplies ere they continue on."
2162871,The Dusk Throne,"A grand monument marking the sacred site where Nhaama, goddess of the moon, is said to have created a corporeal form of herself and become the Dusk Mother. The sands of time, however, have ever disdained the works of men, and for all its prodigious size, the desert is threatening to swallow it up."
2162872,Reunion,"Once a united people, the Xaela were divided into over fifty disparate tribes, but by gathering here they may be as one once more. Such was the hope of the Qestir when they founded this hub of trade. Nowadays, in addition to all the peoples of the Steppe, merchants from foreign lands may be seen here as well."
2162873,Chakha Zoh,Resting within this shrine are the bones of a revered Xaela woman who fearlessly faced a monstrous dragon in order to protect her people. It is customary for tribes that triumph at the Naadam to come here to make an offering.
2162874,The Dawn Throne,"A grand monument marking the sacred site where Azim, god of the sun, is said to have created a corporeal form of himself and become the Dawn Father. Tended and improved over the years by the Steppe's most powerful tribes, it now rests upon the waters of Azim Khaat and is crowned by a magnificent palace."
2162875,The Destroyer,"Over the course of centuries, disciples of the Fist of Rhalgr worked away at the rocky cliff, carving it back to create this colossal image of the Destroyer. By virtue of its size, it is said to have stood defiant through the mad king's savage attack on the temple, and stands defiant to this day."
2162876,Bloodstorm,"Set at the feet of the Destroyer, this monument enshrines in stone the words of a high priest of the Fist of Rhalgr:<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>A storm of blood approaches fast,<hex:02100103>Hells open, Heavens weep.<hex:02100103>For no one soul doth lie beyond<hex:02100103>The measure of His Reach.<hex:021A020103>"
2162877,The Yawn,"Writhing with a mysterious pink substance, this cavernous hollow was torn from the earth during the titanic struggle between Omega and Shinryu. In a bid to bring down its steely foe, the primal unleashed a beam of all-consuming light from its maw, the slightest veering of which could have been disastrous for the nearby M tribe village."
2162878,Ala Ghiri,"Situated along the highroad connecting Ala Mhigo to the rest of Aldenard, Ala Ghiri once served as a trade hub and a vital waypoint for overland trade with the East. Under imperial rule, that trade came to focus upon catering to the needs of the occupation force."
2162879,Specula Imperatoris #2,"Its name meaning “the Emperor's watchtower,” this forbidding military installation is situated at the heart of the mountainous Peaks region. For long years it has cast its menacing shadow over the land and people's hearts both, dominating the skyline as an ever-present reminder of imperial rule."
2162880,The Sunken Destroyer,"This image of the Destroyer was erected on Loch Seld to mark the Fist of Rhalgr's designation as the state religion of Ala Mhigo. Then, the faith's star waxed bright, but such days were not to endure. Deeming the monks a threat to his rule, the mad king set about their destruction, and ordered his personal guard to tear down the image, sending it sinking to the depths."
2162881,The Ala Mhigan Quarter #2,"A residential area situated to the south of Ala Mhigo. Under Garlean rule, it was assigned for the use of the Aan, those lowliest subjects of the Empire not accorded citizenship. During that time, it was also known as the Peregrine Quarter─a reference to the derogatory name by which the imperial occupiers called Ala Mhigan natives."
2162882,The Statue of Zuiko,"Depicted in majestic detail astride his rearing steed is the great warlord Zuiko, revered founder of Suenokuni. While his realm occupies the southern region of Shishu encompassing Kugane, it must be noted that the port city's administration alone falls under bakufu jurisdiction."
2162883,Rakuza District,"By special permission from the bakufu, this commercial district enjoys considerably relaxed trade restrictions. Wares find their way here from the world over, as do visitors of all persuasions, who have no shortage of amusements and hostelries to keep them entertained and rested in turn."
2162884,Tenkonto,"In the Far Eastern tongue, Tenkonto means aetheryte. Since ancient times in Hingashi, the construction and maintenance of these devices have been the exclusive domain of the Onishishu, a collective of skilled craftsmen who jealously guard their secrets. As a portal into Kugane, the area is kept under strict surveillance by the Sekiseigumi."
2162885,Kugane Ofunakura,"Founded under the auspices of Kugane's lord bugyo, this facility specializes in the construction of smaller crafts and the repair of visiting vessels. Accordingly, the shipwrights employed here are versed not only in local shipbuilding traditions, but in foreign techniques as well."
2162886,Shisui of the Violet Tides,"Hidden away at the bottom of the Turquoise Trench, this magnificent palace is home to the Ruby Princess, leader of those Raen who dwell beneath the waves. While its beauty can be appreciated from afar, special permission is required to enter the grounds─a privilege seldom granted."
2162887,East Othard Coastline,"Blessed by the bounty of the Ruby Sea, the eastern coastline of Othard has long boasted a flourishing fishing trade, and villages like Isari are a common sight. The region also abounds in natural beauty, as numerous poems throughout the ages will attest."
2162888,Crick,"For the longest time, folk gave these shores a wide berth for fear of the kami, who they believed erected the enigmatic tower known as Heaven–on–High. The pirates of the Confederacy harbored no such fears, however, and one day they claimed the land for their own and established an outpost."
2162889,Imperial Hypersonic Assault Craft L-XXIII,"The letters emblazoned upon its rusted fuselage mark it as the 23rd craft of the XIIth Imperial Legion. Dispatched to Doma in a bid to suppress the rebellion, witnesses say it was brought down by the vulpine guardian of Yanxia, to sink to its watery grave at the bottom of the One River."
2162890,Mol Iloh,"The current home of the Mol, one of the many Xaela tribes that roam the Azim Steppe. Being nomads, their stay here is but temporary, and the turn of the seasons will see them strike camp in search of greener pastures for their livestock. Though quite sturdy when erected, the yurts are designed for ease of relocation."
2162891,Moai Statue,"Similar statues are said to be found scattered across the world, but it is not known who made them, nor to what end. The absence of horns and the position of the ears have led some to believe that they were fashioned by Hyurs in their own likeness, but there is as yet no conclusive evidence."
2162892,The Rotunda,"Upon stepping foot inside the Crystarium, one is greeted by the sight of a stately domed structure, walkways and hallways branching away from its walls like arteries from a beating heart. Yet it is in the visitor's own heart that this elegant construction of black iron and shimmering crystal is like to remain."
2162893,Musica Universalis,"Grand in title as it is in size, the Crystarium's largest marketplace is an impressive sight. Its shelves groan under the weight of an overwhelming variety of wares, including those manufactured by the Crystalline Mean and exotic goods imported from locales as distant as Kholusia and Amh Araeng."
2162894,The Cabinet of Curiosity,"This towering vault contains countless scrolls, tomes, and moldering manuscripts salvaged from the furthest reaches of Norvrandt. Representing the grammarian branch of the Trivium, the Cabinet welcomes visitors in search of anything from the most complex academic texts to illustrated works for children."
2162895,Rapture,"Found in the northern district of the Crystarium, these elegant towers serve a myriad of functions. For refugees of the Flood, Rapture provided not only dwellings, workshops, and defensive facilities, but also a much-needed reprieve from the prevailing sense of despair and constant danger."
2162896,Temenos Rookery,"Managed almost exclusively by the Zun, this rookery echoes with the sounds of creatures great and small, from the clucks of chickens to the kwehs of chocobos. Said to describe a “sacred enclosure,” the name is a reference to the legendary roosts of the amaro, and indeed, many an amaro is raised from egg to adult within the rookery's well-tended grounds."
2162897,The Glory Gate,"This grand entrance leads into the Buttress layer of Eulmore─a sudden and jarring shift into a world of splendor. Crowds of hopeful petitioners yearn for the chance to pass through its ironbound doors, but the path to “glory” is far narrower than the width of the gate would suggest."
2162898,The Derelicts,This shanty town provides shelter for the destitute masses which huddle around the base of Eulmore. Many have built shacks with planks scavenged from the derelicts─sea vessels left to rot once the Flood of Light made the oceans impassable─while others simply squat in whatever remains of the ships' broken hulls.
2162899,Eulmoran Army Headquarters,"The offices of the vaunted Eulmoran military. Though once ensconced in the Canopy above, the change in policy which accompanied Lord Vauthry's investiture as ruler saw the army fall in prominence, its officers relegated to the mid-layer chambers which once served as the city's gaol."
2162900,The Beehive,"The Beehive is a place of noise and excitement─a little sting to invigorate the safe, pampered lives of Eulmore's free citizens. Regardless of gender, this establishment's bonded workers are often called “honeybees,” while the owner reigns above them as “queen.”"
2162901,Fort Jobb,"Once the forward base of a long-faded knightly order, these ruins were repurposed to serve as a defensive outpost for the Crystarium guard. The architectural remnants of the Church of the First Light now merely hint at the majesty of a bygone era."
2162902,Radisca's Round,"Located in the center of Lakeland, this watchtower is named in honor of a soldier who saved countless lives when he warned of a flying swarm of sin eaters. The soldier himself was slain in battle, having chosen to remain at the tower and delay the eaters' pursuit."
2162903,Laxan Loft,"In the old tongue of the elves, “Laxan” is the word for “Lakeland,” and it is here that the region's erstwhile king set his throne. The castle is also infamous as the site of a historical conflict, where the Shadowkeeper led a force of elven dissidents in a final, bloody uprising."
2162904,The Ostall Imperative,"The well-preserved remnants of a fortress dating back to the glory days of Lakeland. This imposing structure was named in honor of one Ser Ostall, who, according to the tales, ordered his men to stand their ground against a ravening horde of sin eaters. The knight himself refused to fall, holding off the abominations until the smallfolk had reached safe refuge."
2162905,The Hour of Certain Durance,"These crumbling ruins are all that remains of a Lakeland prison. To the east, at the base of the cliff, can be seen another memory of the past─the domiciles of the prison wardens. Once known by a less-somber name, “Mortal Irons” is thought to better reflect the settlement's abandoned state and the transient fate of its residents."
2162906,Sullen,"Weed, Brick, Knot, and Lap─the fishing village of Sullen sprawls across these four small islands, its bridges connecting each location to the next, and thence to the shore of the Source itself. The settlement's name, it seems, was agreed upon as a self-deprecating nod to the oft-creased brows of its resident fishermen."
2162907,Cracked Shell Beach,"When questioned on the rather prosaic name of this coastline, the inhabitants of nearby Stilltide simply point to the carpet of broken seashells. In earlier days, they say the beach was crowded with the comings and goings of local fishermen, but now it is mostly the boots of barbaric hobgoblins leaving tracks along the pebbled shore."
2162908,White Oil Falls,"This waterfall marks the midpoint of Watts River. The sluggish current sends water over the cliff with little force, the cascade cleaving closely to the rock as it plunges down from an impressive height. Upon observing this almost-viscous flow, a renowned poet is said to have likened the falls to an enormous trickle of oil."
2162909,Gatetown,"Gatetown is a haphazard mess of shacks and lean-tos─the result of refugees throwing up shelters as they await their chance to embrace the comforts of Eulmore. Though living conditions can best be described as “abysmal,” the regular distribution of meol and minimal risk of eater attacks has only seen the population increase over time."
2162910,Wright,"A farming village in the southern reaches of Kholusia. The residents of Wright have refused the largesse of Eulmore, preferring instead to subsist upon barley, vegetables, and other crops cultivated through time-honored methods. Their independence cost them dearly, however, when the appearance of a stray sin eater ended in unspeakable slaughter."
2162911,The Ladder,"This enormous mechanism facilitates travel between Kholusia's lowlands and highlands. Its gears once driven by the tireless Talos of Daedalus Stoneworks, the apparatus fell into disrepair after said company retired its operations in the region─a development which all but halted trade with the highland dwarves."
2162912,Tomra,"One of the dwarven settlements which dot the slopes of Mt. Gulg, Tomra is home to a sizable branch of the Tholl family. Every building is constructed on a scale to cater to the diminutive inhabitants, giving taller races the impression of a village built in miniature."
2162913,The Duergar's Tewel,"The far end of the Dwarven Hollows opens up into a great, crater-like expanse. Geysers here spew volcanically heated water high into the air, spraying the uncaring dwarves as they mine deposits of sulphur and other valuable minerals."
2162914,The Red Serai,"This amaro roost was established by Crystarium merchants plying their trade in Amh Araeng. Tucked within the foreboding walls of Qasr Sharl, the waypoint and its stockpiled goods are well protected from both predators and windblown sands."
2162915,Mord Souq,"The Mord have long dwelled in Amh Araeng, and this “souq” or “city” serves as a marketplace to display the curious wares they gather from every corner of the badlands. Merchants and collectors from across Norvrandt can be seen here purchasing ores, oddities, and the relics of Nabaath Areng."
2162916,The Pristine Palace of Amh Malik,"In the common tongue, “amh malik” translates into “majestic king,” and it was within this royal residence that was housed the core of Nabaath Areng's political and military might. When the Flood came, however, it was halted moments too late─half the palace toppled before a titanic wave of Light like a sand castle caught by the tide."
2162917,Mount Biran Mines,"The shafts carved into the side of Mount Biran were the center of a large-scale mining operation which employed the relentless strength of an army of Talos. As is the case with Garik, Kelk, and many other places in the region, “Biran” was a name taken from a Ronso of historical note."
2162918,Twine,"In days past, Nabaath Areng contracted a Talos engineer to establish its mining railway, and these cabins were built to provide lodgings for the laborers who would lay the trolley tracks. The settlement was later maintained as a miners' village, but its dwindling population has mirrored the steady decline of the mining industry."
2162919,Kelk,"The ruins of a Ronso settlement. Residents abandoned Kelk for the cities long before the Flood arrived, and thus it is known amongst scavengers as a prime location for finding trinkets and relics untouched by conflict."
2162920,Lydha Lran,"Finding it abandoned by its former inhabitants following the events of the Flood, the pixies have claimed this Voeburtite village as their own. The fae have continued the villagers' practice of keeping sheep, making use of the weed-choked pens to raise and milk their wooly livestock."
2162921,The Bookman's Shelves,"Lately the borrowed residence of a foreign scholar, this manor once belonged to a Voeburtite lord known for the eclectic nature of his hobbies. In a miraculous turn of events, the noble's extensive collection of books and academic apparatus have largely been left undisturbed by curious pixie hands."
2162922,Pla Enni,"Known for their harmonious relationship with the now-faded Kingdom of Voeburt, the Nu Mou people reside in this cavern under the leadership of their elder, Wyd Aenc. As well as being the name of the village, “pla enni” is a variety of mushroom the Nu Mou grow to incredible size─large enough for them to hollow out and use as comfortable dwellings."
2162923,Deepwood Swim,"In the time of Voeburt, when Lyhe Ghiah was yet known as Gruenes Licht, these ruins were a thriving castle town. Now they languish at the bottom of Longmirror Lake, submerged in the waters drawn forth by the Fuath as the faeries laid claim to Il Mheg."
2162924,Lyhe Ghiah,"Once the royal seat of Voeburt, Lyhe Ghiah later became a prison for Titania when the faerie king succumbed to the aether of a slain Lightwarden. The castle's name has its origin in both the faerie and Voeburtite tongues, the words thought to translate as the “wings of dreams.”"
2162925,Saint Fathric's Temple,"This secluded mountain shelf was favored by Saint Fathric of the Church of the First Light as a place to perform rites of penance. Amongst the faeries of Il Mheg, only the Nu Mou would remember or understand the significance of the location's history."
2162926,Fort Gohn,"Built by the Night's Blessed, little now remains of this wooden fortification. By all accounts, a fire broke out during a sin eater attack, and even before the violence had ended, the compound had collapsed into a charred ruin. Survivors of the slaughter had no choice but to relocate to the nearby Slitherbough."
2162927,Fruit of the Protector,"Cradled within the branches of a giant tree, this immense crystal boulder is suspended above the waters of Lake Tusi Mek'ta. The “Fruit of the Protector,” as it is known, has been the subject of worship since the time of the Ronkan Empire, and even now folk tell the legend of the great entity believed to be cocooned within."
2162928,The Covered Halls of Dwatl,"One of the sacred temples built by the Ronkans, these stone halls were safeguarded by a sect of priests even after the fall of the empire. The rising waters of the lake, however, could not be denied, and rumors persist of a secret treasure which was swallowed along with the temple."
2162929,Lozatl's Conquest,"According to Ronkan legend, the great steps of this waterfall were carved by the giant Lozatl. Historians speculate that this mythical figure was, in fact, an early form of Talos, and likely the selfsame construct responsible for building Ronka's resplendent places of worship."
2162930,Fanow,"Unfailingly loyal to the last-known commands of the Ronkan emperor, the Viis of this village have protected the ruins of Rak'tika for countless generations. With many of its sister settlements destroyed by the Flood of Light, however, Fanow faces an uncertain fate in its isolation."
2162931,The Morning Stars,"These pyramids were built to venerate the four chief deities of the Ronkan religion: Ox'Gatorl, keeper of flame; Ox'Charl, keeper of the winds; Yx'Lokwa, bringer of rain; and Yx'Anpa, bringer of the harvest. For the inhabitants of Fanow, guardians of Ronka's heritage, there are few sites more sacred."
2162932,The Ondo Cups,"Hidden at the bottom of the Tempest, this Ondo settlement was established by those few foragers who escaped the Flood's destruction of their homeland. “Cups” refers to the hollows on the shore that remain filled with seawater when the tide recedes—miraculous shelters not unlike the Ondo's refuge."
2162933,The Workbench,"This facility was built by a Crystarium native─a genius artisan seeking to escape from the distractions of the outside world. Although he simply calls the place his “Workbench,” the mundane naming is at odds with the fantastical concept of a forge constructed malms beneath the ocean."
2162934,Where the Dry Return,"When the Ondo beheld the coral within this cavern, its crimson branches put them in mind of a land-dweller's veins─thus began the legend that it was a resting place for finless ones who had perished at sea. It was not until recently, however, that folk from the surface learned the reason behind the rather ominous-sounding name."
2162935,Purpure,"The Ondo use the shells they gather from this cave to make dye, the purple hue prized as a symbol of nobility. It is said that Eulmore's obsession with the color purple can be traced back to these underwater origins."
2162936,Amaurot,"If Ondo testimony is to be believed, this vast city simply appeared overnight. Unlike the ancient remnants which endure silently upon the sea floor, its illuminated towers are of a decidedly different nature─a meticulously new and vibrant metropolis, compelling in its mystery."
2162937,The Leveilleur Estate,"This elegant mansion has stood for three centuries, and is a treasured example of Sharlayan's architectural heritage. For generations, it has served as the home of House Leveilleur─a noble family from which has arisen many distinguished Forum members."
2162938,Scholar's Harbor,"Although known for its distinctively curving piers, the most prominent feature of the city's port is, without a doubt, the towering statue of Thaliak. Sharlayan's patron deity faces out towards the water, His eternal gaze watching over every vessel which arrives and departs by sea."
2162939,The Forum,"In order to accommodate the ninety-nine members of the Forum, the seating in their assembly hall is arranged in the shape of a spiral. Viewed from above, one is reminded of the symbol emblazoned upon the Sharlayan flag─the nautilus shell that keeps the water of knowledge. "
2162940,Noumenon,"The pride of the Studium and parent institution to the Great Gubal Library, this massive collection of scrolls and tomes is the largest of its kind. Knowledge from every corner of the world is collected here, and efforts to compile the <hex:021A020203>Bibliotheca Historica<hex:021A020103>─the ultimate repository of wisdom─is an endeavor without end."
2162941,The Rostra,"This building houses the assembly hall where the Forum debates Sharlayan national policy. Once a simple outdoor plaza, the Rostra would ring with heated discussion through rain, wind, and worse.  Following a death by lightning strike, however, plans were drawn up for the imposing stone structure which now crowns Archons' Design."
2162942,Journey's End,"Occupying the eastern side of Old Sharlayan, the residential district takes its name from the tale of the city's original settlers. History tells that it is upon this hill, alongside a colony of auks, where the refugees of the great flood chose to build their new homes."
2162943,Learners' Meet,"This public lecture hall in Phenomenon is open to Studium pupils and Sharlayan citizens alike. When prominent professors are scheduled to take the lectern, crowds of aspiring academics and established scholars often fill the room to capacity."
2162944,Ruveydah Fibers,"This state-sponsored workshop is famed for producing silk thread of exquisite quality. Its sericulture and weaving techniques were once jealously guarded secrets, but security measures have become lax since Ul'dah and other nations began manufacturing their own silk fabrics."
2162945,Balshahn Bazaar,"If commerce is the lifeblood of Radz–at–Han, then these roofed market stalls would be its heart. Balshahn himself was a legendary merchant who made a vast fortune through trade with other nations. It was his final wish that his estate be spent on the construction of a great bazaar, ever flowing with coin and wares. "
2162946,Nilopala Nourishments,"Hamsa were originally reared for the sole purpose of harvesting their venom, until a breeder by the name of Nilopala devised a technique to remove the creatures' toxin glands. The birds suddenly became a viable source of tender, succulent meat, and, before long, Hamsa dishes were considered a staple of Hannish cuisine. "
2162947,Mehryde's Meyhane,"Owned and run by the eponymous Mehryde, this meyhane offers light meals and beverages, with the main draw being its myriad varieties of liquor distilled by local alchemists. Foreign visitors are often entranced by the stage performers, whose movements incorporate elements of traditional Thavnairian dance."
2162948,Meghaduta,"The palace of the satrap serves not only as a residence, but also as the center of Radz–at–Han's government. Meaning “cloud messenger” in the old Arkasodara tongue, Meghaduta was built at the summit of a rocky megalith, its great doors admitting an endless stream of servants, petitioners, and official visitors."
2162949,Alzadaal's Peace,"Within this mausoleum is interred the mortal remains of Alzadaal, leader of the Auri tribe which sailed to Thavnair from the mainland. By joining the might of his people with the Arkasodara, Alzadaal tipped the scales against the Gajasura, bringing an end to the internecine war of the Matanga tribes."
2162950,Ruveydah Fibers Rooftop Garden,"Hidden from view atop the workshops of Ruveydah Fibers is a squat golden statue of a gaja, surrounded by a garden of mulberry bushes. Sitting upon the statue is said to bring good fortune, the proof of which is tested as one wanders about the unfenced rooftop."
2162951,The Path of Artifice,"This massive lift is one of several which connects the surface of Old Sharlayan to the subterranean research and storage complex of Labyrinthos. At the end of its descent, the mechanism opens up onto the hub of upper Acrinthos, from where passengers or cargo continue onwards towards other facilities."
2162952,Thaumazein,"Thaumazein, or “wonder,” is the emotion one feels at the onset of the quest for knowledge. Such a quest was begun here, in an effort to pierce the mysteries of the aetherial sea, yet what researchers encountered was the will of Hydaelyn Herself. The site became a shipyard, where they would construct an ark destined to reach the very moon."
2162953,Meryall Agronomics,"In this experimental crop farm, researchers explore agricultural methodology and study the growth of seeds collected from various regions across the world. It is named after Meryall─one of the seven Archons instrumental in Sharlayan's foundation─whose botanical knowledge helped enrich the island's barren soils and resolve food shortages."
2162954,Troglophile's Deep,"This cavern serves as a breeding ground for certain subterranean species deemed vital to ongoing research efforts─including a study into creating fertilizer from the subjects' phosphorous-rich excrement. Troglofauna reproduction is, however, an inexact science, routinely resulting in excessive numbers of cave-dwelling offspring spilling out into nearby habitats."
2162955,Sharlayan Hamlet,"Located in the Central Circuit, this self-contained settlement provides housing for Forum-authorized researchers. Due to the highly confidential nature of their projects and a strictly enforced information protocol, the men and women here are rarely permitted egress to the city proper."
2162956,Yedlihmad,"Meaning “new harbor” in a language brought to the island's shores by mainland settlers, Yedlihmad is Thavnair's main port town. Owing to the shallow waters surrounding the island, however, larger trading vessels are forced to anchor at Alnair, and ferry over to the harbor in smaller boats before making their way to Radz–at–Han."
2162957,Kadjaya's Footsteps,"Known as the mother of the Kriegstanz, Kadjaya is honored in both name and form at this open-air stage for dancers. Those who carry on her legacy perform here beneath her stone-carved likeness, strutting and twirling for the glory of their gods and ancestors."
2162958,Giantsgall Grounds,"Quarried here by the wagonload, the purple-streaked stone known as “giantsgall” is one of Thavnair's most coveted exports. Incredibly dense and possessed of high aetherial conductivity, it is prized not only as a building material, but also as a component in the crafting of unyielding arms and armor, and the brewing of alchemical concoctions."
2162959,The Shroud of the Samgha,"Dense jungle vegetation grows wild and unchecked across a wide band of Thavnair's inland region. Amongst the trees, however, can be found a sprinkling of shrines and temples dedicated to the pantheon of locally worshipped gods─holy sites where once resided the ranks of the faithful."
2162960,The Font of Maya,"This temple was once the abode of an order of Arkasodara ascetics who sought divine enlightenment through the spiritual power that is maya. Abandoned for a stronghold deeper in the jungle, the structure now sits derelict and half-submerged in rainwater."
2162961,The Great Work,"Even in Thavnair, the birthplace of alchemy, the practitioners of House Daemir are renowned for the craft of their concoctions. It was they who founded the settlement of the Great Work, and to this day, many talented alchemists choose to reside here and carry on the family's peerless endeavors."
2162962,Tertium,"Tertium is the third station along the rail network which serves the imperial capital of Garlemald. Equipped as a dispatch yard with generators and other facilities, it was taken over and fortified by the remnants of the Ist Legion following the city's fall into ruination."
2162963,Juturna Platform G,"This mining platform is designed to pump vast quantities of ceruleum-rich water from the icy depths of Cerulea Ingens. Six more rigs were built within the region for the same purpose, but the eruption of civil war brought all operations to a standstill."
2162964,The Runaway Train,"A Mark XLIX passenger train was forced off the tracks by tempered soldiers as it attempted to flee the capital, its twisted bulk left to rust in the ice and snow. Only nobles, high-ranking officers, or citizens with special dispensation were permitted to ride this exclusive service."
2162965,Senaculum Imperialis,"Once the center of government for the Republic of Garlemald, this stately building would later house the Emperor's advisory council. Within its walls, countless campaigns were planned and executed─decisions that would result in untold bloodshed, and bring ever greater prosperity to the Empire."
2162966,Regio Urbanissima,"Here did beat the heart of the Empire─a district pulsing with political, financial, and military authority. Yet these institutions, which once sought dominion over the world, now lie in ruins. Any structure not outright destroyed in the war of succession has been torn apart, its materials cannibalized for the construction of the Tower of Babil."
2162967,Forum Solius,"It was in this square that Emperor Solus inspected his troops before embarking upon his second campaign into the Far East. The imperial legions were ultimately successful in their subjugation of the Kingdom of Dalmasca, and officials celebrated the grand victory by transforming the parade ground into a commemorative public park."
2162968,The Cthonic Horns,"The researchers of this small facility are unlike their colleagues in that they seek to manifest new creations without the aid of creation magicks. Their natural breeding program pairs creatures with differing characteristics, relying purely on chance to conceive heretofore unimagined possibilities."
2162969,Metabaseos Thalassai,"An annex to Ktisis Hyperboreia, this facility is mainly concerned with the observation and evaluation of sea life. Although its construction appears too narrow to support such an ambitious project, the building's interior harbors six separate marine habitats, each painstakingly recreated via arcane means."
2162970,Lethe,"Following a process of exhaustive testing, a creation deemed unsuitable for release into the world is brought to this lake, where its life energies are magically unbound and allowed to dissipate. It is at once the most beautiful as well as the most sorrowful locale in Elpis."
2162971,Ktisis Hyperboreia,"The most extensive facility in Elpis, Ktisis Hyperboreia is a sprawling complex of magically simulated environs. Concepts awaiting evaluation are brought here for the last stages of observation, and, upon meeting the appropriate criteria, are finally released into the world at large. "
2162972,Anagnorisis,"Named for an ancient word meaning “recognition” or “discovery,” this settlement houses those whose job it is to assess the creations admitted to Ktisis Hyperboreia. These observers study every aspect of their charges, and determine if a concept will add to─or detract from─the environ for which it was designed."
2162973,Kydonia Knolls,"This lifelike face of enormous scale appears to peek out from the surface of Mare Lamentorum. Obviously no natural formation, it is nevertheless unknown who carved this piece, or indeed, whose features it is meant to resemble. One thing is certain: the model would not find the depiction particularly flattering."
2162974,The Carrotorium,"This district was specifically designed to sustain the continued existence of mankind, and, more importantly, as a wonderful place to cultivate the miraculous orange vegetables known as carrots. Because let's face it: any trial or trouble becomes easier to bear when one holds a carrot in one's paw."
2162975,Greatest Endsvale,"The architect of this district envisioned an ideal forest─a place where the new residents of the moon could sit or wander amidst arboreal splendor. The fact that it resembles a forest in only the most abstract sense of the word detracts somewhat from the intended effect. Well, it's the thought that counts..."
2162976,Heimdall's Last Sight,"The ancient Allagans launched this Heimdall-class vessel into the heavens to monitor Bahamut's prison, Dalamud. When that colossal satellite awakened around the time of the Seventh Umbral Calamity, the observation craft was shot down as it attempted to halt the activation process."
2162977,The Watcher's Palace,"A structure of enduring design, this brooding tower stands resolute in its vigil of untold millennia. The aetherially conductive plate encircling its spires is reminiscent of a certain architectural style, one found only in the depths of the ocean on the First..."
2162978,Stigma-1,"The prime decision-making authority for an entire machine civilization, this mechanism has been faithfully reconstructed in Ostrakon Deka-hexi. Originally hailed as strategic matrix Alpha-1, catastrophic damage inflicted upon its systems resulted in its currently assigned designation."
2162979,Ostrakon Deka-hexi,"This sector is a recreation of the sixteenth civilization encountered by Meteion and her sisters. Although definitive answers remain elusive, it is speculated that the reconstruction echoes the Alphatron Star as it appeared in its last years, or perhaps even an Omicron outpost built upon an invaded world."
2162980,Ostrakon Tria,"This sector is a recreation of the third civilization encountered by Meteion and her sisters. Known collectively as the “Ea,” the entities which reside here have cast off their corporeal shells and endure eternally in purely spiritual form. An awareness of the universe's inevitable end, however, has blighted their immortal gift with existential misery."
2162981,Ostrakon Deka-okto,"This sector is a recreation of the eighteenth civilization encountered by Meteion and her sisters. Ruined and desolate, the world it represents was once the abode of a proud race of dragons who were driven to extinction in a titanic struggle against mechanical invaders from the Alphatron Star."
2162982,Ostrakon Hena,"This sector is a recreation of the first civilization encountered by Meteion and her sisters. The structures are whole, but hauntingly empty─as if all life had come to an abrupt end."
2162983,Bayside Bevy,"Playing host to a never-ending stream of customers, the largest marketplace in Tuliyollal is replete with goods from every corner of Tural. Its proximity to the harbor ensures that cargo unloaded from the boats and barges can be transported directly to the shelves of local merchants."
2162984,The Resplendent Quarter,"Although seemingly uniform in appearance, a closer look at these domiciles reveals the eclectic adornments added by the residents, the decorations emblematic of each inhabitant's land of origin. If Tuliyollal were a giant bird, then these richly colorful homes would form its resplendent plumage."
2162985,High Tide Harbor,"Due to the abundance of reefs in Tuliyollal's coastal waters, marine visitors are forced to anchor their ships out at sea and board smaller vessels to make safe landfall. The harbor's name is no idle promise, as even boats with shallow drafts can be caught on rocks when the tide is low."
2162986,The For'ard Cabins,"Spanning the length of a pier, these pleasant cottages replaced the previous fleet of boats that once served visitors as rudimentary accommodations. It is said that a foreign explorer was responsible for naming the guesthouses when he likened their rooves to ship prows and their cozy interiors to a captain's cabin."
2162987,Hunu'iliy,"Meaning “heartfire” in the Hanuhanu tongue, this lighthouse also once served as a watchtower for threats approaching from Xak Tural. These days, its only role is to warn coastal vessels away from the thundering waterfalls."
2162988,Wachunpelo,"Nestled in between the mountains, the dwellings of this village are noticeably scaled down to accommodate the smaller size of its inhabitants. It is here that the peddler clan of the Pelupelu manufacture their trading goods such as coffee and mezcal, as well as maintain a ranch for the breeding and training of alpacas."
2162989,Miplu's Mate Garden,"Overseen by the eponymous Miplu, the cultivation of this mate tea garden has introduced lush greenery and fertile soil to Urqopacha's usual vistas of sparse vegetation. The operation has almost become a small village in its own right, with the number of field hands ever growing to match the garden's steady expansion."
2162990,Shades of Grief,"These ruins brood silently at the cliff's edge. Once a Yok Huy village, it was abandoned as the giants' population dwindled, the crumbling stone houses inhabited now only by the shadows of past sadness. Locals speak of a road which long ago stretched from the settlement down into Chabayuqeq, but little trace of such a path remains."
2162991,Naryor Gorna,"It was Valigarmanda's fiery breath which carved these yawning craters, the blackened rocks yet flickering with an intense, incendiary aether known to attract gas-based abominations. If roaming bombs were not enough to discourage would-be sightseers, the gruesome Yok Huy name roughly translates to “the land of scorched and gouged out eye sockets.”"
2162992,Chirwagur Saltern,"This village is inhabited by a faction of Yok Huy who deny the Dawnservant's sovereignty. Thought to have held a sea in ancient times, the valley here seeps with salt-laden spring water. The residents call this natural gift a “divine blessing,” and have built stepped salt fields into the slopes of the valley."
2162993,Worqor Lar Dor,"In the Yok Huy tongue, its name means “mountains most high blooming with all the world's colors.” The sight of rainbow strata arising from a carpet of vivid flowers is almost illusory in its brilliance. Its slopes, steeped in ambient aether, have been revered by the giants as a sacred site for centuries uncounted."
2162994,House of Winds High,"One of the treetop dwellings in Kozama'uka, the House of Winds High takes its name from an estate said to exist in the Hanuhanu's traditional homeland. Practitioners of wind magicks live here as part of their unique training, where they learn to glide down from the house's dizzying heights."
2162995,Cave Kikitola ,"This enchanting hollow was carved out by the unrelenting deluge of three waterfalls─Xodune, Xo'onu, and Xopik'. In hours of darkness, the profusion of luminous moss within resembles a dazzling night sky, hence the Hanuhanu name  meaning “overflowing with many stars.”"
2162996,Breath Between,"Hanuhanu fishermen constructed this landing in the plunge basin of Ku'uxage, driving the piles deep to stand against the fast-flowing current. The mighty falls bear witness to many a furious battle, the fixed fishing poles bending in place as anglers work to land their thrashing catches."
2162997,Kozanuakiy,A reed-woven statue of the Hanuhanu deity Kixaihih is ensconced here in this place of worship. The shrine is believed to stand on sacred ground─a “holy dry land” blessed by the sun's rays in the otherwise swampy terrain.
2162998,Earthenshire,"Possessed of a unique architectural style, the Moblins' home village resembles nothing more than a circle of enormous glazed pots. Among them dwell the “potsworn”─contracted artisans who have agreed to practice their trade in exchange for working conditions personally tailored to meet their every need."
2162999,Marsh Ligaka,"The sluggish currents of this marsh are fed by the waters of Miyakabek'zoma. Its depths are crowded with aquatic grasses, the vibrant clusters of color said to be the result of fluctuations in temperature and ambient aether."
2163000,Iq Br'aax,"Standing on the edge of a cenote in the midst of dense forest, the Xbr'aal's home village has a clearing open to the sky for stargazing. The name of the settlement means “red br'aax”─a fierce beast related to the coeurl─and this bold shade is painted liberally upon the walls of their wooden dwellings."
2163001,Iq Rrax Tsoly,"This vast lake─the “red blood” tsoly─fills the northeastern reaches of Yak T'el. When the Xbr'aal and Mamool Ja once waged war near the lakeside, it is said they consigned fallen warriors to its waters, staining its blue surface crimson."
2163002,The Xobr'it Cinderfield,"For many years, the savage war between the Xbr'aal and the Mamool Ja raged back and forth across this scarred stretch of land. Siege armaments and defensive works yet litter the field decades after the conflict's end, and even the forest greenery seems hesitant to reclaim its ashen expanse."
2163003,Choliselvaas,"This enormous pillar of rock in the Ja Tiika Heartland is thought to be a remnant of the upper forest from when the meteorite fall split the region into two elevations. While the Mamool Ja revere the formation itself, the Xbr'aal are said to hold sacred the trees which grow upon its summit."
2163004,The Ja Tiika Heartland,"An arboreal sea of blue-glowing trees and deep cenotes, the “forest of the brethren” is the spiritual homeland of the Mamool Ja. Although little sunlight penetrates the dense canopy, the pulsing ambient aether provides a constant source of soft, cerulean illumination."
2163005,Tree of Living Light,"This blue-leafed tree has put down roots throughout the waters of Cenote Neyozzote, its twisted trunk wrapped around the crystal core of a fallen meteorite. As well as stimulating the growth of the tree itself, the core and the strange aether it emits appears to be affecting the surrounding plant life."
2163006,Hhusatahwi,"Situated near the Tuliyollal Trailhead, this settlement was originally built as a supply depot to facilitate the exploration and development of the Shaaloani wilderness. As time passed, however, a new saloon and other entertainments drew in the local ceruleum miners, and within a few short years, the depot has become a thriving trading post."
2163007,Mehwahhetsoan,"This village is home to a family of Hhetsarro who have taken the rroneek as their guiding animal. As the name implies, “the land where the hhetso graze” is a nomadic settlement, the tents struck and pitched over and over as they follow the seasonal migration of the rroneek."
2163008,Lake Toari,"Just like water, the moments which make up life rush past in the blink of an eye. In recognition of this truth, the Hhetsarro have given the river which runs through Shaaloani the name “Niikwerepi”─the swift current of time. The two lakes into which it flows are in turn named after the morning and the evening, with Lake Toari alluding to the former."
2163009,Pyaayehe'pya,"Named in the Shetona language, the “hill of many wings” has been the nesting grounds of the yeheheceyaa since time immemorial. The many fossils discovered in the region are evidence of their ancient existence, while the shrill cries of their newly hatched offspring herald their ongoing presence."
2163010,Mount Loazensasaya,"The ancestors of the Tonawawta are said to have stood atop this rocky plateau, puffing on rolled tobacco as they communed with the wind and the land. From this natural vantage point, one can see clear across Shaaloani to Zorgor the Boundless."
2163011,Resolution,"Located in the government sector of Solution Nine, this facility is staffed to resolve matters pertaining to welfare and employment. It is also equipped with infusion stations─machines which dispense souls in exchange for credits."
2163012,Residential Sector,"The citizens of Solution Nine live in structures known as residential radii. These numbered buildings have a common area on the first floor, with each household living above in separate, highly standardized apartments."
2163013,Mosaic,"This popular café is found in Solution Nine's commerce sector. The races of Alexandria are named after stones, and calling the shop “Mosaic” was in acknowledgment of the colorful work of art that is created when the people gather together."
2163014,True Vue,"Lined with bars and fighting stadiums, True Vue is considered the finest entertainment district in Everkeep. The district's current name is based on the popular idea that only those who gather in its back-alley streets see the truth of the world. Staid and uninspired, its official name has seemingly long since fallen out of use."
2163015,Nexus Arcade,"This complex is filled with a variety of shops selling everything from food and daily necessities to personal vehicles. With so many floors and stores to lose oneself in, it is often jokingly remarked that the lost children desk is the busiest place in the entire arcade."
2163016,The Thunderyards,"Gigantic peals of thunder echo endlessly above this desolate plain where the very air crackles with power. Due to frequent lightning strikes, mechanical sentries are unable to patrol here. Thus, despite the presence of energy stations and other important facilities, the area is infested with ferocious monsters."
2163017,The Outskirts,"Situated outside the walls of Everkeep, this laborers' town has taken over the buildings of a previously existing Yyasulani settlement. The majority of its residents are Turali-born, yet even as they extol the virtues of a traditional lifestyle, they nonetheless appear to have embraced a certain level of electrope technology."
2163018,Everkeep,"This immense citadel was built by the Alexandrian survivors of a world-spanning cataclysm. Its twelve levels house factories for producing food and other essential resources, as well as residential areas to accommodate its citizens in relative comfort."
2163019,Crackling Chasm,"According to Alexandrian historians, this chasm was rent open by a weapon of war during the Storm Surge conflict. It has since become a reservoir of concentrated lightning energies, and a massive excavator is in constant operation mining electrope from its depths."
2163020,The Nameslates,"Tucked away in a remote corner of Yyasulani, this small cemetery is a relic of earlier times. Now that the wearing of regulators has become commonplace, the culture of digging graves has largely been forgotten, and tombstones carved with the names of the deceased considered an odd and antiquated custom."
2163021,Archeo Alexandria,"These heavily damaged buildings are all that remain to tell the tale of Alexandria's castle town. It was once boasted a thriving populace, but after the Storm Surge, the ravages of war combined with flooding caused by sinking foundations left behind an unlivable ruin."
2163022,Meso Terminal,"This colossal golden structure arises from the center of Living Memory. A glittering monument to Alexandria's eternal queen, it also serves as the central terminal for Everkeep's core system."
2163023,Canal Town,"A “resort of romance and relaxation,” this charming town in Living Memory was designed around the element of water. In addition to traversing its enchanting canals, one can find fortune at the Font of Devotion, or explore the Daguerreo Medical Collection."
2163024,Yesterland,"Designed around the element of earth, this section of Living Memory features a number of attractions. The esperance wheels and the air cab ride both afford an incredible view of the entire park, while those who prefer to keep their feet on the ground can enjoy a stroll around the historical recreation of Proto Alexandria."
2163025,Windspath Gardens,"This part of Living Memory takes wind as its theme, the expansive gardens providing the stage for a living exhibit of flora and fauna collected from the old kingdom of Alexandria and its surrounds. For the studious, the area also includes a comprehensive museum of nature."
2163026,Asyle Volcane,"Dominated by a lava-spewing volcano, this corner of Living Memory is devoted to the element of fire. Visitors to this molten realm can soak in the rainbow baths of Opal Springs, or observe the deadly occupants of Matchlock Menagerie."
2163027,Steps of the Speaker,"This set of spiral walkways holds records of Milalla history and culture, though their ancestral origin is seemingly unknown. The mask-like decorations in the main hall are said to represent the reverence, adoration, and joy inspired by the presence of the “Speaker”─the title given to the Milalla's spiritual leader."
