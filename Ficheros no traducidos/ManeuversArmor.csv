0,Cruise Chaser,"A next-generation machina fitted with an anti-gravity engine. Gliding into battle, its Spin Crusher devastates thick plate while its Laser Sword and Hawk Blaster make short work of infantry. It forsakes defense in favor of mobility, and its transforming ability has been removed for ease of manufacture."
1,Oppressor,"A hulking machina engineered for siege warfare, it excels at wreaking havoc upon structures. While an army of these can bring down towers and cores with fearsome ease, their heavy armor renders them slow and unwieldy, and they struggle to deal with infantry and other machina."
2,Brute Justice,"Boasting unrivaled power, Brute Justice rules the battlefield with its Flarethrower and Mega Beam while laying waste to structures with its Double Rocket Punch. In order to minimize manufacturing costs, this particular model cannot merge and separate. Such is the way of mass production."
