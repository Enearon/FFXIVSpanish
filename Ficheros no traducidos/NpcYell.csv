62,There are too many of them!
63,Tonight we shall poach the poachers!

170,What in the seven hells is that thing!?
171,No man in his right mind would fish here!
172,You hear that?
173,I need a drink...
174,For the Admiral!
175,"Look alive, privates!"
176,They're only bloody jackals!
177,Must I do everything!?
178,"You haven't had enough, have you!?"
179,"Suck it up, lad! You're a storm soldier now!"
180,Something's wrong... I can feel it...
181,Another victory for the Admiral!
182,A disgrace! Each and every one of you!
183,I suppose it's time I be makin' the rounds.
184,I have a bad feelin' 'bout this.
185,Bloody hells! Not again!
186,"If I never see another cave bat, it'll be too soon."
187,"You stay the hells away from my stock, you filthy flyin' rat!"
188,Me dodos! Someone save me poor dodos!
189,We cannot let these bats out to feed. Their bite'll drive both man and beast to madness!
190,Today is the day! The miller's daughter will finally be mine!
191,"Oh, wherever could he be?"
192,"Many have visited the maiden's garden, yet her flower remains unplucked."
193,"Today, that changes!"
194,"Ah, milady. Will you forgive me for my tardiness?"
195,"Out here, all alone... I was so frightened! "
196,Why did you wish to see me so far from town?
197,"Ah yes, let me explain, my love..."
198,Your love?
199,"Your eyes are like sapphires, your lips, rubies. And your breasts... Those br─"
200,What was that!?
201,A-A-A monster! Save me!
202,Save you!? Who's going to save me!?
203,Do something! Anything!
204,It's your fault we're out here in the first place!
205,I'm going home.
206,W-Wait!
207,"Don't ever call on me again, coward!"
208,B-But I never got the chance to tell you about your br─
209,Hmph!
210,<sigh> I wonder if she has a sister...
211,Did you hear that?
212,Hah hah! Right into me hands!
213,Freebooters! Keep them away!
214,What does it look like I'm doing?
215,Have at 'em lads! Ye keep what ye kill!
216,The damned gobdaw's at it again!
217,Quiet down before I shut you up myself!
218,I told you to stop!
219,I'll show you what we here at the Quay think of stowaways.
220,"Step aside, honeybee. I's no quarrel wiv yer ilk."
221,"I paid fer me passage, proper. The damn captain's fillin' yer ears with gobshite."
222,I ain't no stowaway!
223,You're askin' for it!
224,"I could use a little help over here, sir!"
225,"So it's a fight ye all want, eh?"
226,"That quiet you down, did it?"
227,May the mighty serpent drag yer arses all the way down to the abyss!
228,"So, are you finally ready to talk?"
229,I's less 'an naught to say to you and yers.
230,"Then to the brig it is. Grab the shackles, men."
231,No... Not there again. Anywhere but there! Please! I'll tell you all you want to know! Honest!
232,Godsdammit to the seventh hell and back!
233,"Sod off, honeybees!"
234,"We'll find you, bastard!"
235,No man can rule Ahctstymm Shadowlurker!
236,Get them gropers off me grog!
237,Sod off! I drink what I want.
238,<hex:021A020203>I'll<hex:021A020103> cut ye a new gob so's that ye can drink all grog ye like!
239,Not afore I cut ye a new piss'ole!
240,"Get yer hands off me, honeybees!"
241,Kill every last one of them!
242,Cursed orobon!
243,Coblyns sighted ahead!
244,Don't let those ants take another child!
245,The ore must get through!
246,"Those accursed goats will see this desert reduced to a...well, a desert!"
247,The lizards march west! We must intercept them!
248,Amalj'aa raiders! Men! To your positions!
249,Those bothersome imps are up to no good!
250,The Amalj'aa approach! Meet them in field!
251,What are landtraps doing in the desert!?
252,I told those damn Ala Mhigans to cover their piss!
253,They say the dead rise from the abyss each night to claim the souls of the living.
254,S-S-Souls of the l-l-l-living?
255,You sound as if you believe that bilge!
256,Believe it? No... It's just...
257,Hah! You're worse than my skin and blister!
258,Didn't your ma ever tell you!? There's no such thing as ghosts!
259,Th-Th-Then what is that!?
260,P-Probably just a firefly.
261,It l-l-l-looks awfully big to be a f-f-firefly...
262,Then it's a ship...or a lighthouse...or a...uh...
263,A GHOST!!!
264,Mummy! Save me!
265,Wait! D-D-Don't leave me here!
266,P-P-Please don't claim m-m-my soul!
267,B-B-B-B-Begone?
268,It w-w-worked!
269,Or not! Aaaaaahhh!
270,It's the rats... I can hear their squeaking!
271,The exercise is open to all who wish to join!
272,Why flour? Why not millioncorn or ogre pumpkins or grapes?
273,This place is simply crawling with yarzons!
274,"The goblins'll be here any moment, and then, not a single cog'll be safe!"
275,Need...cores...
276,I wants 'em dead... All dead...
277,My appointment! Whatever shall I tell them!?
278,But how am I to get from <hex:021A020203>here<hex:021A020103> to <hex:021A020203>there<hex:021A020103>?
279,A good beating─that's what these recruits need.
280,"One day, that wench'll be mine."
281,"One day, that wench'll be mine."
282,What did you say!?
283,The wench is mine!
284,And I say she's mine!
285,And I say yer full of crab shite!
286,And I say yer full of...of...more crab shite!
287,"Alright, you two. Clap the traps. She ain't neither of yours."
288,This ain't none of your business.
289,"Aye, this is between me and this here sod."
290,<pant> <pant>
291,"Excellent work, men. The checkpoint is secure!"
292,Thal's balls! You think it will be any easier when the imperials come!?
293,We did it! The day is ours!
294,This bodes ill for the checkpoint...
295,Heh heh. That should teach the lads.
296,It seems my recruits aren't the only ones who are soft...
297,I should've become a culinarian!
298,I see the caravans now. The oranges will be safe!
299,My harvest... It's gone...
300,"These oranges are off to the pleasure boats, you say? Might be I should see the crates there myself."
301,The bridge is ours once again!
302,Bleedin' honeybees... You'd best sleep with one eye open!
303,The galagos! They're gone! I can finally deliver my flour to market!
304,"Pickman! Pickman! Worthy, we are not!"
305,"In the name of Titan, Lord of Crags, crushed shall you be!"
306,"Well, now that's settled, I can get back to work."
307,Doesn't look like the goblins did too much damage.
308,Another shipment lost...and the new one will come out of my pay...
309,Backrun! Backrun!
310,Thank...you...
311,Allow a single peiste to cross and I'll see to it you're docked a full moon's salary!
312,Next season's catch is safe...for now.
313,The coblyns have withdrawn. Return to barracks!
314,Send those pirates plummeting!
315,Ye dinnae get et. <hex:020825E905FF0A>Thank ye.<hex:FF16>Will ye be me new da?<hex:03>
316,The children are safe! Now let us fill that hole!
317,I really should be off. I mustn't keep the noble ladies waiting!
318,The area is clear.
319,"Ah, let us marvel in the beauty of the desert! (Just disregard those goat corpses.)"
320,"Crawl back under your rocks, foul lizards!"
321,To Zahar'ak! Retreat!
322,Wine and glory to the victors!
323,One day this land will be ours again!
324,"<hex:021A020203>You<hex:021A020103> aren't an imp, are you? Hah hah! I jest!"
325,"From dust, to dust!"
326,The desert is no place for rose...ling.
327,You haven't seen the last of us!
328,Mayhap this will teach those degenerates to piss elsewhere.
329,I couldn't have made it on my own. You have our gratitude.
330,Foolish are the sons of man. The past is to be left to slumber.
331,Damned vixen!
332,Is that all? Might be you left your member at home with your blade.
333,"She's all yours, friend!"
334,"If you think you can do any better, I invite you to try."
335,This way.
336,"Now, let us begin."
337,Hah! I've felt bigger stings from a flea bite.
338,"Ah, this is living!"
339,Who's next!?
340,Spineless cravens is what you all are!
341,I-I yield!
342,But I will see you again! I swear it!
343,Another waste of time.
344,Is there no one who can offer me a challenge?
345,My oranges!
346,"Get out of there, you hellssent vermin!"
347,Gyaaah hah hah haaah!
348,Pay the toll! Pay the toll!
349,Empty yer purse out on the bridge and we'll let ye live long enough to watch us gather up the gil.
350,The flour! Won't anyone think of the <hex:021A020203>flour<hex:021A020103>!?
351,Why won't these galagos leave the mill be!?
352,"This land, Titan claims!"
353,"Down, you bow! Lower! Lower!"
354,"Pain, you will suffer! Titan knows!"
355,Grahk! Ghraaah!
356,"Titan sees all! Our pain, He knows!"
357,"Succumb, you will to the cold of the crag!"
358,Not the cogs! It took ages for those to arrive!
359,I did naught to deserve this!
360,Pshhh...kooohhh...
361,Mad gobbies crash groundstomp!
362,Bad gobbies smash toothwheels!
363,Oh! There goes another fry!
364,Wretched swamp spawn! I'd club you myself if I had a big enough stick!
365,Kill the 'bons!
366,Fer me da!
367,You are a plague on the realm!
368,Run! Cower behind your stone walls!
369,We grow weary of your impudence!
370,Throw down your arms and you will be spared an eternity of damnation!
371,Do not resist!
372,Ngrrr!
373,"Yah coOm play, no?"
374,Wharr gonG! Yah coOm bakk!
375,Tyah hah hyah ho ho!
376,Fun noo tOdahh... Fun noo...
377,"Slip open yer purse, like. Or I'll cut it for ye."
378,"No coin, ye say? What've ye hidin' in them smallclothes, then?"
379,We must hurry. It is unwise to pause on the shifting sands.
380,"The Amalj'aa watch from afar. If we are lucky, they will leave us be."
381,Do not let the silence of the sand fool you!
382,These relics could reveal the secrets of eras past. They must be cataloged!
383,I am fortunate to have you by my side.
384,Babaroon is hungry for some crunchies! Adventurer crunchy?
385,"Come come! Crack some, yah?"
386,Babaroon has a bubbly pot! Throws you in the bubbly pot!
387,"Fly, sons of man!"
388,You are filth!
389,Ignorant knobs of flesh!
390,I thought they'd never stop...
391,"They'll soon be at it again, I fear. The two are stubborn as logs."
392,Where are the damned reinforcements...?
393,Ignore the grunts! We seek out their leader!
394,There is no sight of the commander. He must be here somewhere!
395,No matter. We can still sabotage their supplies!
396,Where <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> he!?
397,He can't have withdrawn already. I <hex:021A020203>saw<hex:021A020103> him with mine own two eyes!
398,Who disturbs my meal!?
399,The commander! To me!
400,For coin and country! We have stayed the lizards' hand!
401,We can only hope our efforts gave the reinforcements enough time...
402,Tally our losses and burn the bodies!
403,You have my thanks and the thanks of Ul'dah!
404,Wespes! Sound the bells!
405,Watch for their sting! The poison can cripple a grown aurochs!
406,"What ever should I do, Mother? I can find only boot laces and tumbleweed..."
407,"I did it, Mother! Everything will be alright!"
408,Is there not a single adventurer who would assist me?
409,With these stones I shall prove my disbelievers wrong!
410,Let us dispose of this rubbish!
411,Aye!
412,Blades!
413,The sultana's pigs've come to wallow!
414,"Don't think an Ala Mhigan'll fall that easily, pigs!"
415,Gah! You leave me no choice...
416,Don't let him escape!
417,"Apologies, my captain. I've failed you..."
418,You did what you could.
419,"Ah, and here's the dung heap."
420,For king and country!
421,The Corpse Brigade will never perish!
422,Raiders approach! To arms!
423,Keep the rats off our bridge!
424,For Ul'dah!
425,Don't give those vermin an ilm!
426,Captain!
427,Qiqirn bandits! Hide the little ones!
428,Come back here!
429,See that the supplies are safe!
430,The villagers! The rats look to capture them!
431,We must endure!
432,Keep those damned paws off me!
433,Not the Bowl of Embers! Just kill me now!
434,"Take me if you must, but spare my wife!"
435,Twelve save us!
436,Where are the Brass Blades!?
437,When will this all end!?
438,And the machine roars to life!
439,"Come, my ladies! Let us take the fight to them!"
440,No one dies under my watch. Captain's orders!
441,"There is nothing to fear, but a painful death at the hands of a beastman."
442,"Who shall man the lever tonight, ladies!?"
443,Concise!
444,Precise!
445,Entice!
446,Don't you dare lay a claw upon me!
447,"Did you see that, ladies? Did you?"
448,"Oh, my captain!"
449,Would you look how his chest heaves?
450,See how the sweat glistens on his brow!
451,"I'd take an arrow in the thigh for you, Captain!"
452,Tonight it is I who shall man the lever!
453,"As long as the captain stands, we cannot be struck down!"
454,Protect the captain!
455,<hiss>
456,I'll rip out your eyes and cast them into the chasm!
457,"You won't get far, northborn scum!"
458,Qiqirn bandits!
459,The sun gives us light so that we may hunt in Her name!
460,Hyaaa!
461,Hyaaa!
462,"The sun on our heads and blood on our hands! Life is good, my sisters!"
463,"Lower your bows! Today, we hunt no more."
464,Wherever did I place my lockbox?
465,I won't allow my hard-earned profits to fall into those rats' hands!
466,"I'll never leave you, my captain...in spirit!"
467,Please forgive me! I know not what I do!
468,A thousand thanks!
469,Mayhap it's right time I thought about relocation...
470,Thank the Twelve!
471,Are...are we...still alive?
472,I knew the captain would save us!
473,"Safe...until the morrow, at least."
474,"Now, we strike at their heart! Follow me!"
475,"To the seventh hell and back, my captain!"
476,I smell victory!
477,How could I have let this happen...?
478,Let me tend to your wounds.
479,"No, let <hex:021A020203>me<hex:021A020103> tend to your wounds!"
480,There's something in the wood!
481,"Oh, if there were only someone who loathed colibri as much as I..."
482,SYSTEMS UPGRADED.
483,WAITING FOR COMMAND...
484,"I'm here, my captain!"
485,I shall be your shield!
486,We cannot abandon hope!
487,There! The true enemy shows himself!
488,Come! The villagers need us!
489,The day is ours! Now let us return to Highbridge.
490,Hit them hard and watch them scatter!
491,"One last push, my ladies!"
492,These rats...they breed like...rats!
493,Look! They bend! And what bends will break!
494,"Aim true, my sisters!"
495,Tonight we dine on glory!
496,Rip the teeth from their maws!
497,For the sun!
498,Hyah!
499,Over here!
500,Tonight we dine on worm!
501,Grrr!
502,Ngah!
503,Hmph!
504,Your wounds!
505,Protect!
506,"Die, worms!"
507,Sisters! It...hurts...
508,"Hold, ladies! Hold!"
509,"Ah, named vermin. How quaint."
510,No one will remember your name after I'm through with you!
511,Zuzuroon cares not of names. Zuzuroon cares only of sparklies!
512,"This is <hex:021A020203>my<hex:021A020103> bridge, and it is high time you left it!"
513,Zuzuroon soon be leaving...but with flesh for sparklies!
514,Hullo? Is anyone there?
515,Fall back! We are outmatched and need time to regroup!
516,"Well, then we have no time to lose. I charge by the bell, you know."
517,"Oh, not <hex:021A020203>them<hex:021A020103> again. You might want to draw your weapon."
518,Why won't they just let me be!?
519,"Persistent little imps, they are."
520,Twelve forfend! They simply won't give in!
521,Sparklies! Sparklies! Crates for sparklies!
522,Flesh for sparklies! Many sparklies!
523,Lizards wait with sparkly sparklies!
524,Strong must away. Lizards seek puny stock.
525,"Qiqirn no quarrel with sword swingers. Leave now, and Qiqirn see off!"
526,Sparklies! Sparklies!
527,To market! To market! To sparklies! To market!
528,His Effulgence would have these souls!
529,Insolence!
530,Submit or perish!
531,"My flame dies here, but my Lord's burns ever...bright..."
532,"Twelve forgive me, for I am weak."
533,"This way, then."
534,"Hurry, would you? We mustn't keep the monsignor waiting."
535,What was that? And that? And that!?
536,If the monsignor is without his mead for even a single turn of the sun...
537,Why can't the monsignor get his own mead!?
538,The Sanctum lies just beyond those trees.
539,"We made it! Oh, praise the Twelve!"
540,My neck is saved!
541,"I will repay you one day, my friend. Just...not with mead."
542,"When we're through, I want to be waist-deep in little white mandragora limbs!"
543,Now fall in!
544,And kill them all!
545,P-P-P-Pugils!
546,The hells-spawned thing bit me leg!
547,Keep it away! Keep it away!
548,I didn't hire you to just stand there!
549,Mother!
550,The mead! You can have it! Just spare me!
551,Gods! Now they've surrounded us!
552,"Oh, kindly Matron, take me to Your ivory bosom and away from this hell!"
553,Where is this <hex:021A020203>gift<hex:021A020103> Master Gegeruju promised?
554,I do not enjoy being made to wait.
555,"Apologies, milord. I hope you did not wait overlong."
556,"Ah, Master Gegeruju. You know me well."
557,"You may approach, my kitten."
558,"There is no need to rush, milord. Thanks to the master, we have <hex:021A020203>all<hex:021A020103> night."
559,Hehehe heh...heh heheh...
560,This rose is mine!
561,I won't let none have her!
562,Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
563,Who dares disrupt the rite!?
564,I smell fresh blood!
565,The master will be pleased!
566,Ye'll regret comin' 'ere!
567,"Off our land, ye foul shite!"
568,The mill is <hex:021A020203>ours<hex:021A020103>!
569,How's about some steel fer supper!?
570,Come an' get me!
571,"Don't forget, we's pirates!"
572,Hah hah hah hah!
573,Die! Captain's orders!
574,A knife to the gut'll serve ye fine.
575,This'll hurt you more than it does me!
576,I'll drag ye down to the abyss meself!
577,Let me go! I'll pay double what the lizardmen are offering!
578,Freedom never tasted so sweet!
579,Took you long enough...
580,I thought I'd never see Highbridge again.
581,What in the blary 'ells is that!?
582,Grab yer steel! The mill's under attack!
583,Keep the damn things off the 'ampers!
584,Kobolds! Gut the mecky cave dogs!
585,"First rats, then kobolds, now coeurls!? What's next? Aurochs!?"
586,Thal's bulls!
587,"No rest fer an honest pirate, eh?"
588,Curse the Twelve!
589,"Wivout that grain, we'll starve like...rats!"
590,There be too godsdamned many of 'em!
591,Go piss on some other tree!
592,Nobody said aught about aurochs!
593,I's killed me share o' rats o'er the years. What's a few more?
594,"The bigger they come, the more there be to kill!"
595,Monsters seeing! Qiqirn fleeing!
596,This stench! It could only be...
597,Qiqirn! A whole pack heads this way as we speak!
598,"To arms, men! We must defend the tower!"
599,That should keep them at bay for now.
600,"But where there are ten rats, there are ten score. They'll be back."
601,"That's enough for today, lads."
602,There'll be more toads to gut tomorrow.
603,"Now, let us back to the Wench. The first round is on the Admiral!"
604,"That's enough, lads."
605,I can see your hearts just aren't in it.
606,Let us back to the Wench. A nice warm ale'll lift your spirits!
607,Killin' ain't no different on land than it be on the sea.
608,Only pirate what'll give ye quarter's a dead pirate.
609,And don't be comin' back!
610,Burn the bodies. We don't want 'em foulin' the water!
611,We'll be eatin' good tonight!
612,Yo ho ho!
613,"Today we fought! Tonight, we drink!"
614,<spit>
615,Start skinnin' the dead! I need somethin' to wipe me arse!
616,I'll see each an' every one of ye in the seventh hell!
617,"If a pirate cannot gut a blary rat, she ain't worth 'er weight in salt."
618,Tell yer Titan I sends me regards!
619,"Ye'll ne'er see naught as that on the seas, me lads!"
620,I should've stayed on the sea.
621,"Failures as pirates, failures as millers, failures as fighters..."
622,Bugger all!
623,Now what'll we eat...?
624,They was jus' toyin' wiv us.
625,The mill... She's ruined...again...
626,Let's not forget the fallen...
627,<cough>
628,I'll need to seal up this wound afore it festers.
629,Damn this place to the seventh hell!
630,"I've 'ad enough. A pirate needs 'er a ship, not a mecky mill."
631,A little rust on the sword arm...
632,"'Aven't yet rightened me land legs, I reckon."
633,Ye've a whole blary mountain to muck about on. Leave us be!
634,"O'Ghomoro is ours! All ours! Cast off, overdwellers! Cast off!"
635,"Yer neck is hanging by a thread, lad."
636,Titan will not suffer you on His mountain! Cast off! Cast off!
637,Cast off! Cast off!
638,The rocks will crush you! The mountain will shun you!
639,Titan! Save uuuuuusss!
640,"Come, then! Quickly, yet quietly."
641,Mills is fer millers. Do I look like a mecky miller!?
642,The Eighth Umbral Era'll be upon us afore this mill's repaired...
643,Thal's balls!
644,I'm done. Done wiv it all!
645,What I wouldn't give for a breath o' sweet salt air...
646,Bugger this damn place!
647,Now that was a thing o' beauty!
648,"Tell me, how did it feel to whack them beasties good?"
649,"Oh, if only I were still young."
650,"Hells, I <hex:021A020203>am<hex:021A020103> still young! Might be next time I join ye!"
651,Slippery bastards!
652,'Tis a shame we couldn't thwack 'em all.
653,"But they'll be back, and I'll be waitin'."
654,"Waitin' fer <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> to help again, that is. Gah hah hah hah!"
655,"Now it may be I can fish 'ere in peace, like."
656,Me leg? It'll be fine. I'll just dip 'er in the river a spell.
657,Shhh... The desert speaks...
658,No...
659,Sisters! The worms! They gather!
660,"<pant> <pant><hex:02100103>Our tribe was tested today, yet our strength proven once again."
661,"You will have vengeance, my fallen sisters... I swear it!"
662,Another hole lost to the bloody hells-spawn.
663,The guildmaster won't like that one bit...
664,Wild beasts have made these fields their home.
665,Now we reclaim what is rightfully ours!
666,Another quiet day in Quarterstone.
667,Or is it...?
668,"Pirates! Storm soldiers, make ready!"
669,Wait... Those are Serpent Reavers!
670,The fields are clear again.
671,But we must remain vigilant. The stubborn beasts will likely come crawling back.
672,"We underestimated the beasts, today."
673,I won't let that happen again.
674,Enter the Whorl!
675,Nghaaahaha hah hah!
676,Heh... Heh heh...
677,<gurgle> <sputter>
678,BWAHAHAHAHA!
679,Drown...and be reborn!
680,"Your time will come, drylanders!"
681,Back to the grot!
682,Their eyes... Did you see their eyes?
683,"Aye... Those men are dead, and they don't even know it."
684,I fear I cannot make it alone...
685,I pray the local levy has seen to the Westroad.
686,I don't remember Tidegate being so far...
687,"Make haste, adventurer."
688,I shall not disappoint the Admiral again!
689,Back to the hills with you!
690,The Maelstrom thanks you. Till sea swallows all!
691,Godsdamned lemons!
692,Do not stray too far from me now. I fear this ankle won't hold much longer.
693,You don't see any more creatures do you? And lemons. What of lemons?
694,"Ack! This is it! The end! Thal, take me!"
695,Not the ankle!
696,Now to soak this ankle in a piping hot tub...
697,"A fine day for fishin', if I do say so meself."
698,I'll catch somethin' big today. I can <hex:021A020203>feel<hex:021A020103> it.
699,What's that? Somethin's odd with the water...
700,Efts!
701,Someone! Anyone! Help!
702,"When I said I might catch somethin' big, I never meant <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103> big!"
703,How am I to fish with all these damned efts about!?
704,"I can't fish in that water, what with all them rotting eft corpses..."
705,Might be I need to find me another hole...
706,What a day...
707,What a bloody fine day for fishin'!
708,We shall crush our enemies and revel in their fear as they tremble before us!
709,"Forward, beasts of flame!"
710,Dare you defy me!? I said <hex:021A020203>forward<hex:021A020103>!
711,Another lash will teach you to obey!
712,"The drakes, they would set us at naught!"
713,Inflame our enemies!
714,Obey!
715,Commander! The drake... It <hex:021A020203>relieves<hex:021A020103> itself on our supplies!
716,You shall pay for that!
717,See them all burn!
718,"Rise, I say! Rise and attack!"
719,"Attack, or I'll kill you myself!"
720,Our Lord will not be pleased...
721,There! Do you not see the enemy!?
722,Commander! These drakes! They fail us!
723,These would serve better as meat for our men!
724,Enough! We continue another day.
725,This is futile. Fall back to Zanr'ak!
726,The Westroad's not safe this far from Limsa.
727,"With all this danger lurking in the shadows, how do people even survive out here?"
728,They don't.
729,"Ah hah hah hah hah! Yellowjacket humor, no doubt."
730,No.
731,Engage!
732,Resistance is futile!
733,Soon Eorzea will be ours!
734,The weak shall be assimilated!
735,How ever will I pass with those...those...<hex:021A020203>things<hex:021A020103> standing there!
736,Shoo! Shoo! Away with you!
737,"A thousand thanks, good traveler."
738,"Do I wait, or do I brave the hills...?"
739,Don't make me have to brave the hills!
740,Finally!
741,Pshkoooh! Who is it that backstalks Wormwix!?
742,Deathwords bring slimy beasties for bumlicking!
743,Deathwords bring fiery beasties for bumburning!
744,Deathwords bring buzzing beasties for bumbiting!
745,Wormwix is thinking about maybe making busydeal with wideheart adventurer...
746,Bastard of Light! Bow down to the one true god! Bow to Dalamud!
747,The souls of the Lambs never sleep!
748,The souls of the Lambs never forgive!

754,Burn! Burn Buuurrrnnn!
755,The Inferno awaits me!
756,Your souls cannot be saved until they have burned in the seventh hell!
757,"Rise, my brother, and walk at my side once again!"
758,"Rise, my sister, and reclaim what was wrested from your grasp!"
759,"Rise, my father, and strike down our enemies with rage!"
760,My kin... Soon...we shall be reunited once...again...
761,This one's wings shall darken the moon and bring everlasting night!
762,"Come hither, arbor pets!"
763,This one tires of the game!
764,Death to the spoken! Death to all!
765,Take...these broken wings...
766,You were foolish to come here alone!
767,Victory shall be mine!
768,Do not think you have won just yet!
769,I may have underestimated you...
770,You have not seen the last of me!
771,Thirty-one is come!
772,"My alchemies, powerful, they are!"
773,"Know, I do, the secrets of the Land!"
774,"Hewn, we are, from rock! To dust it is we crumble! So sayeth Titan!"
775,O Lord of Crags! The pain! The pain...!
776,Come! The one true god awaits your sacrifice!
777,O Dalamud! Baptize these wayward souls in thy crimson radiance!
778,Let the blood red flames burn away your sins!
779,"Tonight, the blood price shall be paid in full!"
780,My lord... Why hast thou forsaken...me...?
781,None can stand the searing heat of my flames!
782,"Try and match my speed, pathetic smoothskin!"
783,You have not seen the limits of my power!
784,The land will melt and the seas will boil!
785,The flames! They flicker and...die!
786,"Zezeroon's heart is filled with sadness. Supper is there, but Zezeroon's here!"
787,Zezeroon's belly is filled with rumblings and grumblings!
788,Zezeroon's nose is filled with the sweet smells of meats and treats!
789,Zezeroon's ears are filled with the cracklings and sizzlings of supper!
790,"Zezeroon's heart is filled with joy! Thank you, adventurer!"
791,This one is so lost and lonely...
792,"Where, oh where is Little Solace?"
793,Is Little Solace far?
794,This one should never have left the camp...
795,This one shall never forget walking one's kindness.
796,"Oh, what ever is a moogle to do?"
797,I thought I said no autographs!
798,Why don't I simply choose not to be seen? Pah! Then what sort of celebrity would that make me?
799,"You can all look, but absolutely no touching, kupo!"

813,This area is a tad more...rough than I imagined.
814,"How can anyone survive the night, let alone run an entire farm with all these terrible creatures about!?"

829,I sense danger all around us!
830,"I believe I can complete the journey on my own. You have my thanks, adventurer."
831,"Pardon me there, adventurer. Might you know the road to Ul'dah? I seem to be...lost."
832,One would think a traveling merchant might have a better sense of direction.
833,"Oh, I do hope this whole affair does not put a hamper on our shipping agreement."

851,Pah! Some good you are!
852,Our work here is complete. Now back to the custom house with these crates.

913,You're soft! Soft like a baby's arse!
914,"Going to let some adventurer shame you like that, eh!?"
915,Redbellies! To me!
916,My wounds! Someone see to my wounds!
917,Where are all my men!?
918,Squawk!
919,Cap'n is strong! Cap'n is strong! Squawk!
920,Scurvy dog! Scurvy dog! Squawk!
921,Batten down the hatches! Batten down the hatches! Squawk!
922,Two-legged lubber! Two-legged lubber! Squawk!
923,Parley! Parley! Parley! Squaaawk!
924,The nightmare is finally over!
925,Maybe now I can finally get some work done.
926,"What work is that, you ask?"
927,"Why, pullin' weeds, of course! Ones that don't bite back, mind you."
928,The damned things are like weeds.
929,I suppose there's no escapin' them.
930,Best I return to the fields and assess the damage.
931,I reckon I have a lot of replantin' to do.
932,We shall take the Westroad.
933,"Watch your footing, lest the sand drag you under."
934,I will not forget this.
935,I didn't want it to come to this!
936,Damnable 'venturers!
937,Our hard-earned gil's escapin'!
938,"Well, don't jus' stand there, ye dogs!"
939,Get yer heads out of yer arses and heal me wounds!
940,Ye can have the ruddy turtle!
941,Thal's bloody balls!
942,Unfeathered!
943,Squaaawk!
944,Urth... Whither hast thou gone...?
945,"Urth... One day, I <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> find thee..."
946,Soon Urth... Soon...
947,Who is it that would deny me passage?
948,Foolish mortals...
949,Canst thou hear the lamentations?
950,Here I stand─a god amongst men. Yet here I remain─a mere man amongst gods.
951,Mine obsidian blade shalt split atwain the threads of thy future...
952,...whilst its crimson fuller shalt channel the lifeblood of thy past!
953,Thou knowest not thy folly. Forfeit is thy waking soul...
954,The sea'll wait. She always does.
955,The mill needs mendin'. We need concern ourselves with naught more.
956,It may take these legs a few more summers to get used to the land.
957,I miss me the Deep...
958,"One day, I'll be back on the Blue. I swear it."
959,But this place be ours!
960,"As much to be had on land, as there be on the sea, I reckon."
961,Have ye aught to say?
962,'Tis time we learned to be lubbers.
963,Danger in these woods. Lots of scaries scares the sparklies.
964,Open for trade! Trade for sparklies!
965,"Many, many sparklies!"
966,Conjurer! I need you!
967,"Conjurer, I cannot stand much longer!"
968,Send the beasts running!
969,Not a single wolf shall pass on my watch!

980,You will not have our camp!
981,Sound the alarum! The enemy draws nigh!
982,For Ishgard!
983,Hold the front!
984,The knights of House Durendaire will never break!
985,The feast is about to begin...and your minds are the main course!
986,"Dance for me, slave of stone!"
987,"Another dance, my slave! The dance of death!"
988,Dalamud will rise once again!
989,You have forced my hand...
990,Now from the depths of the seven hells will terror rise!
991,"Open the gates, my lord, and send your minions through!"
992,"Heed me, servants of the Hound! Your place is in this realm!"
993,You cannot stop what has already begun!
994,The children of the wood are no match for the denizens of the dark!
995,Dalamud will lap at your lifeblood and grow ever stronger!
996,The corruption is worse than I expected...
997,I have time to do naught but defend...
998,This corruption must be sluiced clean.
999,Ready your blades! We meet the gigas on the field!
1000,The site is ours! Back with you to your mountains of cold!
1001,I never met a beast I couldn't eat! And tonight it looks like a feast!
1002,Gah hah! Start the fires! I'll ready the meat!
1003,Will nature answer my call?
1004,I can feel it! The strength of nature flows through me!
1005,Are you here to guide me back to camp? Splendid!
1006,I apologize. I was examining that amazing formation.
1007,"None of those pesky gigas up ahead, are there?"
1008,You are certain this route is safe?
1009,"Ah, back at the camp. And just in time for treacle tart!"
1010,Squaaawk! The grimoire is mine!
1011,I control the winds! Squawk!
1012,I control the snow! Squaaark!
1013,Rise from the void! I summon thee! Squaaaaaark!
1014,I only wanted...wings... Squaw...k...
1015,I AM MIMAS! MIMAS CRUSH YOU!
1016,WOLF! TO MIMAS!
1017,RAAAWR! MIMAS ANGRY!
1018,GWAAAAAARGH!
1019,MIMAS...TIRED...
1020,Tracking me to the ends of the realm... You truly are naught but the archbishop's hounds.
1021,"Descend on these pawns, my friends!"
1022,"Come to me, O ye of ancient blood!"
1023,You have woken the dragon!
1024,Beware... My death...will only serve to stir others...
1025,MY PEOPLE CLIMB TOWER AND RETURN TO HEAVENS!
1026,MY PET SUCKS MARROW FROM YOUR BONES!
1027,THEY ARE NOT ALL WHO HEED MY CALL!
1028,"YOU ARE STRONG, BUT WE ARE STRONGER!"
1029,THE TOWER...I CAN...SEE...
1030,Seize them at once!
1031,Raaar!
1032,Such insolence!
1033,Bastards!
1034,Remain strong!
1035,These things are as soft as yer mum's arse!
1036,"It's like slaughtering pigs in a pen! Ugly green pigs, mind ye."
1037,What in the seven hells─!?
1038,"K-K-Keep away from me, you monster!"
1039,It's back!
1040,We need to leave... Now!
1041,Hear the screams of my fallen brothers!
1042,And so it ends here...
1043,"I will repay this debt, good adventurer!"
1044,"Now, we must make haste. The wolves are not but a few yalms back."
1045,There! They show themselves!
1046,"We must show them our strength, or the pack will continue their pursuit!"
1047,"Back to the wood with you, kwaaark!"
1048,Die! Die! Diiieee!
1049,"Tear out their eyes, kraaawk!"
1050,"Can you bear the wind, smoothskin!?"
1051,Squark! This is no place for you! Leave at once!
1052,I shall teach you to fly! Straight into the chasm!
1053,Squaaaaaark!
1054,Something not of this world walks the sands. It must be stopped!
1055,We can only pray there are no more...
1056,The flames of our Lord cleanse us of our sins.
1057,"Tempered in fire, our hearts grow harder!"
1058,Let the holy flames engulf you!
1059,Halt! Do not think we won't strike you in the back!
1060,Leave us be!
1061,The punishment for your insolence will be swift!
1062,Witness the power of the undying flame!
1063,The taste of victory is always bitter when fouled by Ul'dahn blood.
1064,It's as if a mountain has come to life!
1065,"If I never see a living mountain again, it will be too soon!"
1066,"Forgive us, brothers!"
1067,Know what we do is for your own good and the good of the realm!
1068,
1069,
1070,
1071,
1072,Take...these mortals... Release them...from this...realm...

1106,BROTHEEER!
1107,INSO...LENCE...KHAK!
1108,EURYTOS...NO...DIE...
1109,Give the giants no quarter!
1110,No quarter!
1111,Hark! 'Tis the sound of their steps as they approach!
1112,Gods... There must be hundreds of them...
1113,Silence! Are you a craven or are you a knight of House Haillenarte!?
1114,Steady. Wait for my signal.
1115,Forward! Attack!
1116,Attack yourself!
1117,Better to be a live coward than a dead...anything!
1118,Reserves! Send in the reserves!
1119,So...cold...
1120,A fine display! If only those who ran could have witnessed your bravery!
1121,Damnation! Fall back to Camp Dragonhead!
1122,Hear ye! Hear ye!
1123,Lock your doors! Batten your windows!
1124,The goobbues are coming!<hex:02100103>The goobbues are coming!
1125,Are... Are they finally gone?
1126,They are too much for us! To the Locks! We shall regroup there!
1127,Help!
1128,I don't want to die!
1129,"Your tempering will come soon enough, mortals!"
1130,"I say, are there none who would escort me?"
1131,"Very good, then. Shall we?"
1132,"Stay alert, my friend. The gigas in these parts have no love for our kind."
1133,Would you look at this! A remarkable specimen!
1134,Can you see how the crystal resonates with the sound of our footsteps?
1135,Simply marvelous! I must have a closer look!
1136,The Sons back at the camp will not believe this!
1137,"Ah, here we are!"
1138,It was a miracle that we met with nary a single setback.
1139,I suppose I have you to thank for that!
1140,"Now, to work!"
1141,Listen! Do you hear that?
1142,Nothing! The howling has finally subsided!
1143,"I will live to see another sunrise. My thanks to you, adventurer!"
1144,Crocs! And here in Coerthas!
1145,Any closer and we'll be eaten alive!
1146,But these sacks must be delivered! What can I do?
1147,Kweh!
1148,They're gone! I can complete my delivery!
1149,"I don't know how to thank you! Oh, wait! Gil!"
1150,Kweeeh!
1151,Another day lost. My employer will take this directly from my pay...
1152,"Giant's foot, my rosy red arse!"
1153,We did the best we could...
1154,Might be I can reason with them. I studied giant at the scholasticate and am fluent in four dialects.
1155,The answer is “steel!”
1156,You won't mind if we stay back a few paces...just in case.
1157,Holler if you need my help with the dialects!
1158,Riddle me <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>─what kicks giant arse?
1159,<hex:021A020203>Your<hex:021A020103> foot! Hah hah hah hah!
1160,"I must admit, those who say the pen is mightier than the sword..."
1161,...have never faced giants!
1162,I still think we could have reasoned with them...
1163,"...though, they did not appear to respond to any of the dialects..."
1164,"This is not over, you hear me!?"
1165,I knew we should have just gone back to the Front.
1166,"You see. You should have let me reason with them! Four dialects, I said! Four!"
1167,Enemy at the Gates! Secure the portcullis!
1168,Make ready for the Horde!
1169,"Spears up, heads down! Advance!"
1170,How many sailors are on this ship!?
1171,I have this front in hand!
1172,"Bah, ye bloody useless scrags!"
1173,"Stand clear, unless you fancy a trampling!"
1174,Giants from the west!
1175,Prepare to intercept and engage!
1176,Do not let them gain the shore!
1177,"Well done, men!"
1178,Gather the wounded. We make for the Observatorium immediately.
1179,There are too many!
1180,Gather the wounded and fall back to the Observatorium!
1181,Look! The spirit of Saint Daniffen!
1182,Wait... That's not─ Heeeeeelp!
1183,O Wrathful Fury in heavens on high! Pray give me strength to overcome the evils of this world.
1184,<mumble> <mumble> <shudder> <mumble>
1185,Praise Halone!
1186,You have not forsaken me!
1187,Halone!
1188,Why have you forsaken me?
1189,"Figures to be a cold one, today. 'Twas a cold one yesterday, too."
1190,And I would guess them's the reason why!
1191,Ice sprites! Push them back from the Cloak!
1192,My thanks.
1193,It's about time!
1194,Mamool Ja bandits spotted out beyond the rise!
1195,"Drop weapons and gil, you live!"
1196,Mamool Ja take what ours!
1197,"We'll find ye one day. And when we do, it's to the brig with ye!"
1198,Mamool Ja no run.<hex:02100103>Mamool Ja <hex:021A020203>plan<hex:021A020103>.
1199,Sound the bell! The Sahagin approach!
1200,Drive the beasts back!
1201,Hold the wall!
1202,Shhhkewer the Maelshhhtrom!
1203,Hishhh!
1204,Hah hah! Till sea swallows all!
1205,We have what we came for. Back to the shhhea!
1206,Forward!
1207,Drive them from the walls!
1208,You shhhall drown in your own blood!
1209,Shhhend them to the abyshhh!
1210,"This wall is ours! Remember that, fishbacks! "
1211,The Pushhher is fallen!
1212,The bell! The bell! Fishbacks march from the south!
1213,Keep them off our wall!
1214,Fillet the bastards!
1215,Another victory for Tidegate!
1216,The Puller will be pleased. Back to the shhhea!
1217,Fear not the breathers of air!
1218,To the bottom of the abyshhh with you all!
1219,Follow in my wake!
1220,Shhhee that none shhhurvive!
1221,"This wall has stood for five summers unbreached, and it shall stand another five hundred!"
1222,They have shhhilenced the Puller! Back to the shhhea!
1223,Shhhend in the van!
1224,Backfins to Voll!
1225,"Hushhh, breathers of air!"
1226,These ones are shhhtrong...
1227,Shhhurrender to the shhhea!
1228,"Leviathan, shhhave ushhh!"
1229,Kill the intruders!
1230,Leviathan'll sup on yer blood!
1231,Throw off yer armor and I might just let ye live...long enough to see me don it.
1232,Me blade will cut yer flesh like the sea.
1233,Ye should 'ave run while ye 'ad the chance!
1234,"Who do ye think ye is, comin' in <hex:021A020203>our<hex:021A020103> lair, lookin' to quarrel?"
1235,"Skippers! A whole damned plague of 'em, to boot!"
1236,Let the scavengers clean up the mess.
1237,Protect the pickman! Protect the mines!
1238,The ores are ours! Ours are the ores!
1239,The ores are mine! Mine are the ores!
1240,Send the greedy overdwellers over the cliff! Over the cliff!
1241,Bury the greedy overdwellers under the rocks! Under the rocks!
1242,Grenades on the planks! Hide the firesand! Ready the pikes!
1243,"That should do us for now, but I want a man on the planks day and night."
1244,Somethin' ain't right with them raptors...
1245,What ever it was put them raptors in a frenzy's still up there...
1246,The hells!?
1247,Get 'em!
1248,Over there!
1249,Why must you just sit there like some...some...toad!?
1250,Ribbit?
1251,<sigh>
1252,Then it is settled! Slay away!
1253,"Did you hear that, you slimy beast!? You're through!"
1254,Ribbit! Ribbit! Croaaak!
1255,We are unlike our brethren. You will not be shown the mercy of tempering!
1256,The Gore Horde! The Amalj'aa elite!
1257,"They will torture and kill any they find, whether he be man or child!"
1258,We stop them here!
1259,"Push harder, Flames!"
1260,For coin and country!
1261,The heads of your fallen will be presented as a gift to our Lord!
1262,Let the flames of the present～♪
1263,Consume our prayers past～♪
1264,And burn all vows unspoken～♪
1265,To light our future path!♪
1266,Graaahhh!
1267,Fear not the frigid hands of death...
1268,...for the flames have foretold our victory!
1269,"We did it! Here's the forty-eight percent, as promised."
1270,"Fifty-one, you say? Are you certain?"
1271,"Alright, alright. Let's make it forty-nine and a half and call the deal square! Ta-ta!"
1272,"Not only couldn't you do away with the toads, but you managed to trample up the entire camp!"
1273,"There's naught left to claim, could I claim it! Another abandoned leve, I'm afraid..."
1274,Gah hah hah! I'm the best!
1275,Take this!
1276,An' this!
1277,Bah!
1278,Bugger...bugger... 
1279,The hells with this!
1280,Um... Hello?
1281,"Say my name, brothers! Say. My. Name!"
1282,"Ah, an adventurer! Lend an engineer a hand, would you?"
1283,"I could have used a few more round pegs, but such is life!"
1284,I'm not staying here any longer. Who knows when the imperials will be back for their machine?
1285,Look behind you! A three-headed goobbue!
1286,Fall in behind the pilus prior!
1287,All hail the emperor!
1288,Eorzea will not be yours for long!
1289,I'll show you why the 3rd Cohort is most feared in the legion!
1290,Follow me!
1291,The young ones must not fall into dark hands!
1292,This one's heart is filled with wrath!
1293,Spoken ones must leave at once!
1294,Mine! All mine! Sqwaaark!
1295,"Take! Take! Take, we shall!"
1296,Sqwark!
1297,Die...  Die... 
1298,Vengeance... 
1299,Good adventurer! A great dragon approaches!
1300,Svara will not wait for us. Come!
1301,"Have your weapon ready. It is not a question of if the Horde finds us, but when."
1302,If only Bertha were here. She'd rip a hole right through 'em!
1303,Hurry. The Steel Vigil is not far.
1304,Thank you! But my work today has only just begun.
1305,So...so many... 
1306,"Bugger, I can't go on... "
1307,It appears we have made it with all our limbs still attached.
1308,The gigas are naught but cowards.
1309,"They wouldn't hesitate to attack an unguarded caravan, but place a few blades at the van and─"
1310,You might want to wait before completing that thought.
1311,Th-Th-They don't look all that cowardly from here!
1312,Shields together! Form a wall around the findings!
1313,"Not even time for a piss, eh?"
1314,"Less talk, boys. More blood!"
1315,"Our rage, our rancor... "
1316,For you... For you... 
1317,Did it escape!?
1318,The rancor! The rancor!
1319,Behind us!?
1320,"Take that, vile fiend!"
1321,Come...♪
1322,Thank the saints!
1323,"In most circumstances, I would commend you on your bravery and send you on your way."
1324,...but these documents aren't going to carry themselves to the camp.
1325,Seems the gigas had a bit more fight in them than I thought.
1326,Not <hex:021A020203>enough<hex:021A020103> fight is how I see it. Hah!
1327,"When you boys are done patting yourselves on the back, we've still got work to do."
1328,The documents...
1329,They were...irreplaceable! A lifetime of knowledge...gone!
1330,What am I to tell the Sons!?
1331,We're lucky to have made it out with our hearts still beating.
1332,That doesn't make the taste any less bitter.
1333,"That will teach you to underestimate your enemy, fools."
1334,This hammer will not hold them back for long!
1335,Stay away!
1336,Try and keep the dragons from nippin' our arses.
1337,"Once Bertha here is hale and hearty, we'll show them dragons what for!"
1338,"Keep one eye on the sky, and the other on the ground. Not all the Horde have wings!"
1339,I need more time. Bertha's a fickle lass.
1340,No more of this for me! I'm back to the Locks!
1341,Ol' Bertha's standing once again! Now where's that dragon!?
1342,Thou...♪
1343,Why...♪
1344,No...♪
1345,Isn't there anyone who can help me?
1346,We must move these logs to the library for proper cataloging.
1347,"Oh, dear. Not here... Not now!"
1348,The Horde!
1349,The Dravanian Horde attacks!
1350,I'll slice your throat and kick you from Witchdrop!
1351,For the Fury! For Ishgard!
1352,The logs... They are lost...
1353,Now to collect the tears.
1354,Water sprites! How in the Fury's name will I fill my phials!?
1355,Enough of this place. A warm hearth awaits me back beyond the Gates of Judgement.
1356,"My client will be...disappointed, to say the least."
1357,Then let us make haste.
1358,I pray Haldrath's March is clear.
1359,We must hurry. The archbishop is not one to be made to wait.
1360,These astroscope readings could change the outcome of the war. They cannot be lost!
1361,I can see the aetheryte's glow. We are almost arrived!
1362,"My thanks, adventurer. You were more than a capable escort."
1363,Now I must be off to find that courier. Good day!
1364,What in the world is that thing!?
1365,Wolves!
1366,Good gracious! Look at the size of that maw!
1367,But we are so close!
1368,Aaahhh!
1369,The findings! I must protect them!
1370,Keep it off of me!
1371,What is─?
1372,These readings must be delivered...
1373,Where did these things come from!? They weren't here a bell ago!
1374,They're making for the camp! Someone <hex:021A020203>do<hex:021A020103> something!
1375,That was too close...
1376,Curse these little legs!
1377,Hapalits!? You look as if you could use some help!
1378,"Ah, the thrill of victory!"
1379,At least we were able to force them back...
1380,Those Mamool Ja wear the sign of the Crag! Their loyalty has been bought by the kobolds!
1381,This road cannot fall into beastman hands!
1382,Drive the sellswords to the seventh hell!
1383,"As long as their pockets are lined, they'll be back."
1384,Fall back and inform the camp that the road is compromised!
1385,This road now kobold road. Pay in gil or pay in blood!
1386,Too many blades. Not enough coin promised.
1387,The Climb is safe...for the moment.
1388,These puppets cannot be contained! We must fall back and regroup!
1389,The area ahead is under kobold control.
1390,The beastmen <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> make an attempt at our supplies.
1391,"And we will see that they fail, sir!"
1392,Gwark!
1393,"What do you see, sir!?"
1394,It's not what I see...but what I smell...
1395,...and I smell kobolds!
1396,It's an ambush!
1397,"Sir, behind us!"
1398,Shields up!
1399,Gwark! Gwaaaaaark!
1400,"We're out of the fire, but not clear of the kitchen. Push ahead!"
1401,"You have Limsa's thanks, adventurer."
1402,Someone! Help!
1403,We are still quite far from our destination. Stay close.
1404,Stay close. Understood.
1405,"If I were any closer, you could smell the squirrel I ate this morning."
1406,Come then.
1407,Kwark! Kwark! Kweeeh!
1408,Blasted 'bo!
1409,Well that was interesting...
1410,What should we do?
1411,We cannot leave without that bird. He's carrying half our charge!
1412,"How's this─you two wait here with the good 'bo, and I'll look for the other?"
1413,Are you sure that's a good idea? The jungle is rife with danger.
1414,Kwaaaaaark!
1415,What in the seven hells is wrong with you? You've been kwarking since we left!
1416,Oh... That would be why...
1417,That was closer than I would have liked.
1418,Where is that drunken fool?
1419,"That was quite the piss. Are you sufficiently relieved, then?"
1420,"Bah, I'd tell you, but you wouldn't believe me anyway."
1421,And that we can agree on.
1422,I suppose there are worse ways to die...
1423,...I just cannot think of any.
1424,They've eaten my love...again!
1425,<whimper>
1426,<click> <click> <click>
1427,You are truly a hero! If only I could find a man like you!
1428,Now do what heroes do!
1429,<hiss>
1430,Not me! That one! Eat that one!
1431,Many sparklies for Jijiroon. Jijiroon overjoyed!
1432,Little sparklies for Jijiroon. Jijiroon drowns sorrows in pelican eggs.
1433,<twitch> <twitch>
1434,La la la la la la la la la LA LA LA LA LA LA la LA la LA LA!
1435,Thisoneisthisoneisthisoneis...
1436,Hah! Haha! Hahaha! Haaaaaa!
1437,Bad spoken one!<hex:02100103>Bad spoken one!
1438,Who is spoken one?
1439,Spokenonespokenonespokenone...
1440,Root! This one needs more root!
1441,This one's head is spinning and spinning and spinning and...
1442,Rooot! Roooooot!
1443,Why can I not bathe in springs!?
1444,I've already told you. It is forbidden.
1445,"My coin, same coin as smoothskins'!"
1446,This is not about your <hex:021A020203>coin<hex:021A020103>. It is about your <hex:021A020203>behavior<hex:021A020103>.
1447,What behavior!?
1448,Your...<hex:021A020203>leering<hex:021A020103>.
1449,Mamool Ja have eyes. Eyes must see something!
1450,And the...unsightly grinding and gyrating of your pelvic region.
1451,Ah! Traditional Mamool Ja bathing dance!
1452,I care not what you call it! It will not be tolerated!
1453,You cannot stop bathing dance!
1454,I pay my coin! I dance my dance!
1455,What is decided is decided!
1456,Leave this place and never return!
1457,Memories only fade if there is no one to remember them...
1458,This one is eternally grateful.
1459,"As long as this one has life, the memory of the fallen ones will endure."
1460,Mamool Ja stay! <hex:021A020203>You<hex:021A020103> go!
1461,I'm afraid I cannot allow that!
1462,Today we march on the encampment!
1463,Sir!
1464,"Whatever happens, do not break! Understood!?"
1465,Understood!
1466,Do you want to live forever!?
1467,Yaaahhh!
1468,Enemies at the fore!
1469,Aye!
1470,Enemies to the rear!
1471,We're surrounded!
1472,The Amalj'aa... They knew we were coming!
1473,Reform the line! The encampment is ours!
1474,Grab the wounded and fall back!
1475,Something is amiss...
1476,"Blow 'em a kiss, Bertha!"
1477,"Bertha'll keep you warm, foul dragon!"
1478,Pay the lady no mind! She'll see you're well taken care of!
1479,You killed my brother!
1480,For the Fury! For Ishgard!
1481,"Die, dragons! Each and every one of you!"
1482,Victory!
1483,The day is ours!
1484,Where are those damn lizards?
1485,Did they spot us and circle around?
1486,Or was the scout mistaken...?
1487,<hex:021A020203>There<hex:021A020103> they are!
1488,Hold the pass! Don't let a single one through!
1489,The enemy is retreating!
1490,Then we regroup and make pursuit!
1491,Th-The enemy is retreating!
1492,Thank the Twelve!
1493,Ah hah hah hah hah!
1494,Spoken ones die tonight!
1495,This one's poisons consume minds! Corrupt souls!
1496,Give spoken ones no quarter!
1497,Are they here?
1498,"If I am not at the plant in a bell, I will be ruined!"
1499,Splendid! Now let us hurry. There is no time to lose!
1500,What was that!? I think I saw something move!
1501,Or...not. Come on then.
1502,Halt!
1503,"One cannot be too careful, you know."
1504,Shhh! Did you hear that? No?
1505,"Wait! Now, you may think I am being overly cautious, but..."
1506,You know how the proverb goes...
1507,It's better to be safe than strung up and gralloched by a bloodthirsty maniac!
1508,There is something ahead... I can <hex:021A020203>feel<hex:021A020103> it!
1509,We are not but a quarter malm from the plant but...
1510,I... I made it in one piece! Thank the Twelve!
1511,If only you could have gotten me here sooner!
1512,"Alright, tell me you heard <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!"
1513,Caution can ofttimes be a man's best friend!
1514,You see! You see!<hex:02100103>I felt it! I <hex:021A020203>felt<hex:021A020103> it!
1515,I have no coin! I promised it all to the adventurer! That's the one you want!
1516,Why...? Why no springs?
1517,"Mamool Ja is man, like all men..."
1518,Finally.
1519,"Now, back to...er...seeing that these women are...uh...safe. Yes."
1520,No man talks ill of Mamool Ja custom and lives!
1521,"You, lucky today. I come back tomorrow. I come back and dance!"
1522,<moan>
1523,And don't...come back...
1524,I'm not paying you another man's coin to let them manhandle me!
1525,Not the tunic! This cost me a fortune!
1526,I'm too rich to die!
1527,Mercy! Have mercy!
1528,"Stop playing around, adventurer, and get this thing off of me!"
1529,Gods up above!
1530,This is looking bad...
1531,A fine spring that was! The view was simply spectacular!
1532,Oh... This is not good.
1533,How am I to get back to camp?
1534,"Oh, I cannot begin to express my gratitude!"
1535,I was in a cold sweat for the duration.
1536,Perhaps I should go back to the spring and warm up...
1537,What ever is a Lalafell to do?
1538,I suppose I'll just have to return to the spring and wait.
1539,"Though, now that I think about it, another dip would be quite refreshing!"
1540,Why must you overdwellers always disturb my research!? Why!? Why!?
1541,My next experiment will use your blood! Your blood!
1542,The Gyve will not fall to the sons of man!
1543,No manner of spell or steel can penetrate our wall!
1544,My bow sees all!
1545,You will drown in a storm of arrows!
1546,Run! Your back will make an easy target!
1547,The Amalj'aa are attempting a summoning! We must silence them before it's too late!
1548,We've a hero in our midst.
1549,Now march!
1550,Just as planned!
1551,This should keep the lizards quiet for a spell.
1552,But don't think they won't be back. They always are.
1553,How could this have happened!?
1554,"If a few sand lizards cannot be stopped, then we are doomed!"
1555,"You have my thanks, adventurer. Do not let our failure here discourage you."
1556,"I must be returning soon, so if you happen to have a core or five in your pocket..."
1557,"The ceruleum is safe for another day! From stray vibrations, that is. A single bomb and...boom!"
1558,Not as many cores as I had hoped...
1559,"I'll just have to cross both fingers tonight, then."
1560,It'll take me the better part of the day to move all these crates back up into Wineport...
1561,The buccaneers! Keep them back from me wine!
1562,Me wine! It's safe!
1563,It's still strewn about the ground... <sigh> But at least it's safe!
1564,Me wine... It's all gone...
1565,I think I needs me a drink...
1566,Me wine... I can't bear to look!
1567,The vintner'll have me head...if the pirates don't get it first!
1568,What was that shattering? Was it a bottle!?
1569,"Back to the jungle with you, you dirty thieves!"
1570,Leave this man be!
1571,Your head will look good on a pike above the hamlet gates!
1572,And don't think of coming back!
1573,I broke nary a sweat.
1574,Damned pirates...
1575,We've failed you... Please accept our apologies.
1576,A few more blades and we would have had them!
1577,I won't forget this!
1578,"Out o' me way, dogs!"
1579,Hahahahahaha!
1580,Looks like yer 'avin' a spot o' trouble wiv the wain!
1581,Who says the Twelve don't smile on pirates!?
1582,Ever 'eard o' the law o' possession!?
1583,Why buy what ye can take!?
1584,"We'll be seein' ye again, peddler!"
1585,Thal's balls!
1586,"Back to the lair, boys!"
1587,Tonight we drink deep!
1588,"To the trees, sylvan ones!"
1589,Leave the dead. They will only weigh us down.
1590,To die at the hands of a beastman...
1591,Imperial ones foul the wood with smoke and soot!
1592,Revenge for fallen ones shall be swift!
1593,"Now that the imperial unit is no more, the remaining sylphs have drawn back into the wood."
1594,Or have they!?
1595,"My thanks. Without your help, I would be lying there cold with the other imperial corpses."
1596,Your treachery will not be allowed in the Twelveswood!
1597,For the Adder!
1598,Ye want some o' this!?
1599,"Take that, ye bloody bugger!"
1600,Sod off!
1601,I'll skin ye and throw yer bones to dogs!
1602,"Make ready, then. The buccaneers could be here at any m─"
1603,Over there!
1604,The place'll be swarmin' wiv honeybees and the Admiral's 'ounds.
1605,"I ain't never met an 'oneybee I couldn't swat, nor an 'ound I couldn't kick."
1606,"I'm goin' to drink meself a river, that's what I'm goin' to do!"
1607,Been a long while since I drunk me some real red. I've 'ad enough o' that shite Shorty makes in 'is boot.
1608,Gah hah hah hah!
1609,"How's this fer a plan─I'll do the cuttin', ye'll do the guttin'."
1610,"Workin' up a right thirst, what wiv all this fightin'."
1611,Ye 'ave no right to be here!
1612,Gah hah hah hah!
1613,We was just mindin' our own!
1614,Damn the Admiral's 'ounds to the seventh 'ell!
1615,Ye'll pay fer this! A pirate never forgets!
1616,Damn the Admiral's hounds to the seventh hell!
1617,There'll be no raidin' till these bloody 'urts mend.
1618,"Alright, you filthy scrags! Your plan is up!"
1619,Throw down your weapons or feel the brunt of the storm!
1620,This is easier than jointing a pig!
1621,What's wrong!? Having second thoughts!?
1622,All in a day's work.
1623,When has a band of landlocked pirates ever been a match for the Maelstrom?
1624,"The louder they are, the quieter it is when they fall."
1625,Fall back! We'll regroup at Wineport!
1626,"You haven't seen the last of us, scrags!"
1627,Just try and take the hamlet!
1628,We cannot wait any longer.
1629,There's no turning back now! Go!
1630,Till sea swallows all!
1631,I'll see to the tools!
1632,Stay alert!
1633,These are mine!
1634,Watch your back!
1635,And these would be mine.
1636,That's strange... Shouldn't one of their leaders be overseeing the dig?
1637,What if this is not the main dig site?
1638,I wonder how the other units are faring.
1639,"Pipe it down, ladies. There is still equipment to destroy!"
1640,Their leader!
1641,"If we can slay her, the others will fall back!"
1642,"Tight formation, ladies!"
1643,I can't believe it! We actually did it!
1644,Who would have thought that three storm privates could defeat a kobold matriarch!?
1645,"Well, we <hex:021A020203>did<hex:021A020103> have some help."
1646,I told you we should have waited until the main unit arrived...
1647,What were we thinking?
1648,I take full responsibility. Your lashes are mine.
1649,What are you doing!? What! Are! You! Doing!?
1650,"O Lord of Crags, forgive Your lowly servant! I am not worthy! I am not worthy!"
1651,Our shiny tools! Who will mend our shiny tools!?
1652,An eternity of pain and agony to those who harm our tools!
1653,Do not let the overdwellers escape! We take them before Titan!
1654,Stop the overdwellers! Stop them! Stop them! Stop them!
1655,I do not like this one bit...
1656,If our numbers were only greater...
1657,"If we are to attack, we must do it before reinforcements arrive."
1658,"We have the element of surprise, but..."
1659,"Just a little further, boy."
1660,"Here, let me hand you the rei─"
1661,Wark!
1662,"What's wrong, boy?"
1663,Wark! Wark! Kwaaark!
1664,"Shhh... Calm down, now. What do you see?"
1665,The kobolds!
1666,Waaark!
1667,Wait! I thought your leg was─! Damned bird! Get back here or I'll roast you and eat you rare!
1668,"You have my thanks, adventurer."
1669,"Now, when I get my hands on that 'bo..."
1670,I carry nothing! The 'bo has it all!
1671,"It's not me you want, it's the 'bo!"
1672,Look at me! Does it look like I have any crates of sun lemons under this tunic!?
1673,Not the face! Not the face!
1674,"I'll see you in the seventh hell, you bloody coward!"
1675,Who said a 'bo was a man's best friend!?
1676,"Your tools, throw them down! Your weapons, throw them down!"
1677,"Do not hide them from us, overdweller! We can smell them!"
1678,Does the overdweller wish to die like his friends?
1679,"Bow down, overdweller!"
1680,Won't anyone save my daughter!?
1681,Make ready. The shadows gather.
1682,The rite of sacrifice is about to begin. Mwahahahahaha!
1683,I always find it amusing how trusting you adventurers are.
1684,That is right. It is not I who am to be the sacrifice. It is <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103>!
1685,You are not the chosen!
1686,Are there none who would take up their blade and join us?
1687,"Hah hah hah! Then show us the stuff you're made of, adventurer!"
1688,"As stubborn as a rock, and as hard as a diamond. A formidable foe, that one."
1689,He could've had a place in my unit...if he weren't dead! Hah hah hah!
1690,"Well, now we know where the scaled bastard got his name."
1691,But we'll be ready for him next time.
1692,O great one! An offering of blood and bone I bring thee!
1693,Uwaaah!
1694,I'm coming!
1695,I won't give up!
1696,We have failed our lord again!
1697,"Silence, you dithering fool!"
1698,The day is far from over...
1699,Dalamud will yet drink of this one's lifeblood.
1700,For we shall see to it personally!
1701,"Aim low, thrust high!"
1702,Hold that bank with your lives!
1703,Where did that damn 'bo get off to?
1704,Oi! Chocobo!
1705,"There you are. What were you thinking, galloping off like that?"
1706,"Now, to rid me of this wine...wherever this may be."
1707,I fear the worst for our friend. Watch the bird. I will be back.
1708,This place is unsafe. Come on.
1709,We will wait here for our third.
1710,Jijiroon's had enough peckings and pawings for one day!
1711,Here Jijiroon waits!
1712,"Steel your nerves, now."
1713,"It appears quiet, but only a fool puts his trust in silence."
1714,Overdwellers come with food and steel! We take your steel we eat your food!
1715,"Serve the Wailers, earn some coin!"
1716,I sometimes marvel at the resourcefulness of you adventurers!
1717,This won't nearly be enough... I'd best just toss it into the river.
1718,Tell the lot to move their arses.
1719,We're being tracked.
1720,"March, you pitiful scum!"
1721,No one keeps the Lord of the Inferno waiting and lives!
1722,You need not fear fate.
1723,"You will soon be one of us, free from all worry!"
1724,Help us!
1725,"If it is money you want, you can have it. Gems? I have more than you can carry! They're all yours!"
1726,Please...
1727,I'll do anything you ask! Just free us!
1728,I let my guard down for but a moment...but 'twas a moment too long.
1729,"Now, I must find some way to escape these bonds."
1730,You! Adventurer!
1731,Don't tell my unit you saw me here. They'd give me no end of it!
1732,I knew I heard something!
1733,Halt and lay down your weapons!
1734,Let the captives free and your punishment will be lightened!
1735,I've seen that captive before somewhere...
1736,The Immortal Flames!
1737,We're saved!
1738,Not yet we aren't... Something tells me those tempered won't give up without a fight.
1739,"(My unit! Out of all the units in all the realm, why did it have to be <hex:021A020203>my<hex:021A020103> unit?)"
1740,"Let the captives free, eh?"
1741,So you can come over here and slay us like dogs?
1742,There is no truth in the words of the untempered!
1743,Then your lives are forfeit!
1744,Fellow Flames! Give them no quarter!
1745,Focus on the tempered! We'll free the rest once the dirty work is done!
1746,Three more gifts for Ifrit!
1747,The lord will be pleased!
1748,Unless we kill them all first!
1749,We're all going to die!
1750,Aaaaaahhh!
1751,Calm yourselves! Keep your heads down if you want to live!
1752,Good... My unit is none the wiser!
1753,Are you unhurt?
1754,There may be more tempered headed this way. You'd all best make for Little Ala Mhigo.
1755,You... I'd know those ears anywhere...
1756,It's over! It's finally over!
1757,<sob> I thought... I thought...
1758,Might be I join the Flames myself!
1759,.........
1760,Grrraaah! Damn you all!
1761,You cannot escape every time!
1762,We will rise again from the ashes!
1763,Hah hah! Where are your Twelve now!?
1764,"Move, scum! There's no one left to save you now!"
1765,Don't forget the wounded. They are still of some use.
1766,My tariffs pay for <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
1767,I will take my own life before becoming one of...one of them!
1768,I knew there was a reason I never joined the Flames.
1769,And my unit is none th─ Wait! Who's going to rescue me now!?
1770,We cannot give up now! Where is my linkpearl!?
1771,"Captain, my wounds... I cannot march no further today..."
1772,"That Lalafell... It was <hex:021A020203>him<hex:021A020103>, wasn't it!? That fool could have helped us!"
1773,You chose...poorly!
1774,I shall rip apart your body as Dalamud gnaws upon your soul!
1775,Bleed! Bleed for the one true lord!
1776,The Hound stirs with each drop spilled!
1777,"Watch your back, friend!"
1778,Your defense is full of holes...as soon you will be!
1779,"You drag your feet, friend!"
1780,Did you see that? Of course you didn't!
1781,"Stand still, you bloody thing!"
1782,Oi! He's headin' your way!
1783,I've got him! I've got him!
1784,"No, I've got him!"
1785,And here I thought it was the rabbits who was swift.
1786,Seven hells to purgatory! Another one lost.
1787,Calm yourself! We'll just find ourselves another one. Come on!
1788,Keep your ears open and your eyes peeled.
1789,Somethin' that large cannot hide for long.
1790,The swarmpoint won't be pleased if we come home with empty hands.
1791,I can't see a godsdamned thing!
1792,You see anythin' over there!?
1793,Here turtle turtle turtle turtle!
1794,I'll see you cut from ear to ear!
1795,"Run while you can, outsider!"
1796,Find your own damned turtle!
1797,This ain't your wood!
1798,You just wait until we get us a turtle!
1799,You'd best hope our paths don't cross again!
1800,Thal's balls!
1801,"Luck was on your side today, outsider, but we'll see about the morrow!"
1802,Bleedin' outsiders!
1803,"Sleep with one eye open tonight, 'venturer. I'll be comin' for you!"
1804,Damned outsider went and frightened off all the damned turtles!
1805,I ain't tellin' the swarmpoint. You tellin' the swarmpoint?
1806,I can't even remember what we was lookin' for...
1807,I ain't tellin' the swarmpoint. You tellin' the swarmpoint?
1808,I know a place deeper in the wood. Might be we find us a big one there.
1809,What we need is more Redbellies. Let's go back to the Hive.
1810,Arrrggghck!
1811,Dalamud! My liege! Save me!
1812,"My blood and soul, I give unto thee!"
1813,"Ah hah hah! Foolish mortal! I know not of this Dalamud, but if he will not partake in this offering, I claim it as my own!"
1814,Dalamud still thirsts.
1815,Then we shall return on the morrow.
1816,Is that the tusked one?
1817,It is! The bane of the elder one lives! 
1818,The tusked one must pay!
1819,The tusked one must answer for crimes against the elder one!
1820,This one cannot forgive! This one cannot forget!
1821,O elder one! Give this one the strength to exact vengeance!
1822,The tusked one is fallen...
1823,"Yet, why does the heart of this one still feel so empty...?"
1824,"Come back, tusked one!"
1825,Vengeance still burns in this one's heart!
1826,Me poor back cannot take another lashin'.
1827,I'm but a porter. My talents are limited to porting...and little else.
1828,I thank you...and my wife thanks you. Or at least she will after tonight! <wink>
1829,Perhaps I can make it back to an inn...
1830,You wait. The wine'll be sweet this season!
1831,<sigh> Mayhap the morrow'll bring better luck.
1832,The golems have the road. We must take it back!
1833,The stone man wakes! The stone man walks!
1834,Save us! Save us from the stone man! Save us!
1835,Back to the mines! Back to the dig!
1836,The stone man walks!
1837,No more digging! Much more running!
1838,"Titan, save us! Adventurer, save us!"
1839,Pshhh! Shhhend the finleshhh ones below!
1840,Become one with the Whorl!
1841,O Leviathan! Lend us Your strength!
1842,Leviathan is the one true god!
1843,Gods! There are so many of them!
1844,Someone─anyone─call for reinforcements!
1845,Grenades! They're too close to the plant!
1846,Close the blast doors! Turn off the pumps!
1847,No more ceruleum for you!
1848,There's just no end to these damned things.
1849,I will not be defeated. Not here! Not by the likes of you!
1850,We have made it this far...
1851,...but our work has only just begun!
1852,"And what work is that, sir!?"
1853,The work we came here for!
1854,"And that is, sir!?"
1855,"The airstones, you half-witted Highlanders!"
1856,"Midlanders, sir!"
1857,Gah! To the hells with it! You know what to do!
1858,"And that is, sir!?"
1859,DESTROY THE BLOODY AIRSTONES!
1860,"Sir! Yes, sir!"
1861,Commence the operation!
1862,Sir!
1863,I would not believe it if I had not seen it with mine own eyes. 
1864,Hah hah! I was made for this!
1865,"Fall back, you cretins!"
1866,Did we win?
1867,One-eyed demons to the north! To arms!
1868,Don't forget to strip the eyes of the lenses. The Alchemists' Guild'll pay good coin for 'em!
1869,Is there no end to these doblyns!?
1870,If I had a gil for every doblyn I'd slain...I wouldn't be here slaying cursed doblyns!
1871,I will fight the sylphs in a location of mine own choosing!
1872,There is no recourse. We must fight!
1873,"To battle, Dozol goes! Squaaawk!"
1874,"We shall prevail─triumph, win, prevail!"
1875,Time to take the hive!
1876,Spears forward!
1877,"Sting them back, boys!"
1878,Hyah!
1879,Give us another!
1880,I'll show you what it means to wail!
1881,"The rancor! It feeds me, yet consumes me!"
1882,Sylphs approaching quickly! Where are my reinforcements!?
1883,Imperials in the Twelveswood! I must report back to the Adders' Nest at once!
1884,GRRRRRRAHR! BROTHERS! TO ME!
1885,For the Empire!
1886,"Another world, another battle..."
1887,Is this my fate? To fight an endless war?
1888,So be it. It won't be the first time I've spit in destiny's eye.
1889,"Come on, then."
1890,Just another obstacle.
1891,That all you got?
1892,I'll cut you down to size!
1893,I've fought worse.
1894,Let's get this over with.
1895,"Hm? Why can't I─ Well, this is just great..."
1896,"You okay? That was some fight, huh? The name's Lightning. I'm not...from around here."
1897,"I'm not even sure where “here” is. The last thing I remember, I was sleeping."
1898,"I don't know if I'm stuck in this world, or if I'll be sent somewhere else..."
1899,Aaah!
1900,What manner of fiend is that!?
1901,Flee while you can!
1902,Stay back!
1903,Keep your distance!
1904,We'll try to hold it here!
1905,Don't let it come near the city!
1906,Disengage! You're no match for that thing!
1907,You can't fight an armored unit without artillery!
1908,"...Well, you get full points for bravery."
1909,Let's see if I can't help turn the tables.
1910,"You Eorzeans don't give up, do you?"
1911,Back me up.
1912,Now we're talking.
1913,What's a militarized behemoth even doing here? Did it stumble through some portal?
1914,Or was it sent after me?
1915,No! I'm not done with you yet! Dammit...
1916,The beast is dead!
1917,Your aid was most timely!
1918,Strange... I didn't expect to be here after the battle was done.
1919,"Might as well take a look around, then."
1920,"Aid! Aid, I pray you!"
1921,She can't defeat that abomination alone!
1922,I have to stop meeting people like this. I'm afraid my company's going to get someone killed.
1923,I'm beginning to understand the reason I was sent to this place: I'm being tested.
1924,Someone woke me up to see how much fight I had left...
1925,They've come for me.
1926,"They want to drag me back to an ancient, dying world and chain me to a god's will."
1927,Come on! Take me if you can! I will not be a slave! 
1928,"Where is this chaos energy coming from? I thought we cut off the source, but it seems to be getting stronger..."
1929,"If this keeps up, it will overflow into Eorzea."
1930,This deity will stop at nothing to bring me back.
1931,Even if it means corrupting your world with chaos. 
1932,"Well, I've seen enough innocents die at the hands of indifferent gods!"
1933,Odin! To me!
1934,"Thank you, Odin."
1935,"With any luck, that'll be the last of them."
1936,I don't think we won. Feels more like we were judged...unworthy.
1937,"Keep going, kupo!"
1938,"Hurry, hurry!"
1939,"Faster, kupo, faster!"
1940,"Don't leave me, kupo!"
1941,D-Did you hear that!?
1942,"Don't let them hurt me, kupo!"
1943,I can't take this... 
1944,Are we going to die!?
1945,"Have at thee, kupo!"
1946,D-Damn you... 
1947,Impossible!
1948,"I'm not finished with you yet, kupo!"
1949,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1950,That one's mine!
1951,Bloody hells... 
1952,"Gah! That stings, kupo... "
1953,Kupoooooo!
1954,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1955,"Make way, make way!"
1956,"Why, you... "
1957,Again!? Ugh... 
1958,"Leave it to me, kupo!"
1959,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1960,"Yer gonna get it! Right in the bum, kupo!"
1961,"Ack! Right in me bum, kupo... "
1962,Ack! I'm bad at this... 
1963,"Ye can run, but ye can't kupo!"
1964,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1965,"You're in big trouble now, kupo!"
1966,Help! I-I'm in trouble...
1967,"I think I need to lie down, kupo... "
1968,"Oh, deary me... "
1969,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1970,Bear witness to the glory of kupo!
1971,"What to do, what to do... "
1972,"Everyone's so serious, kupo... "
1973,Ever dance with a moogle in the pale moonlight?
1974,Hmph! Next time won't be so easy!
1975,Next next time won't be so easy!
1976,"You're in for a treat, kupo!"
1977,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1978,"Wait, we're doing this now, kupo?"
1979,"Why me, kupo!?"
1980,That's just petty... 
1981,"It'll all be over soon, kupo... "
1982,"Hail to the kupo─I mean, king!"
1983,You are neither a gentleman nor a zombie!
1984,Do not disturb our practice!
1985,"Begone, villain! Leave the Gentle Dead Men in peace!"
1986,The pistol is mightier than the sword!
1987,"Die, featherless ones shall!"
1988,"Rend the enemy to shreds, we shall!"
1989,"Crush the enemy, we shall!"
1990,"Eliminate the enemy, we shall!"
1991,G-Garuda!
1992,Mines mine!<hex:02100103>Mines all miiiiiiiiine!
1993,"Bad men come! Bad men steal!<hex:02100103>Bad men die, die, diiiiiiiiie!"

1995,"Byregot's beard! Come to help us fight the giants, have ye?"
1996,Now let's show these buggers that size don't mean shite!
1997,Momodi! I won't die until I see yer face once more!
1998,Here come the big buggers!
1999,"All in a day's work, eh? Now back to the Quicksand, and the first round's on me!"
2000,"Aye, boss!"
2001,This ain't lookin' good...
2002,Let's get 'em!
2003,That's how it's done!
2004,I'm bleedin' bad!
2005,We're countin' on ye!
2006,We live to mine another day!
2007,They're too...strong...
2008,I can't take much more of this...
2009,Nobody told me there would be giants...
2010,"GRAAAHHH!<hex:02100103>BURN, BURN ALL!"
2011,A giant golem! Run for your lives!
2012,"Much to your chagrin, the experiment shall now begin!<hex:02100103>O～hohohohoho!"
2013,"Begone, foul creature!"
2014,"My minion has fallen? Consider me floored.<hex:02100103>Oh well, back to the drawing board."
2015,"I've collected valuable data from all this fighting.<hex:02100103>Armed with this knowledge, I shall begin my smiting!"
2016,O～hohoho!
2017,"Well, what have we here?<hex:02100103>You're not half as helpless as you appear."
2018,"While I'd like nothing more than to stick around and play,<hex:02100103>I fear I've more important matters to attend to today."
2019,"After all, I've experiments to conduct, and golems to build.<hex:02100103>But we'll meet again...if you can avoid getting yourself killed."
2020,O～hohoho!<hex:02100103>O～hohohohohoho!
2021,"Oh dear, is it already this time of day?<hex:02100103>I really must be on my way."
2022,"Next time we find ourselves warring,<hex:02100103>do try to be a little less...boring."
2023,"Death by stomping, or death by curse?<hex:02100103>You decide which one is worse!"
2024,O～hohoho!
2025,"You can run,<hex:02100103>I won't make fun!"
2026,<yawn> Could you put up more of a fight?<hex:02100103>I'm about to call it a night...
2027,That wasn't wise...<hex:02100103>Prepare for a quick demise!
2028,Have at you!
2029,The horror!
2030,<pant> <pant>
2031,"Matron, deliver me!"
2032,I...f-fear...no...shadows...
2033,I... I thought I was surely dead.
2034,"I owe you my life, adventurer."
2035,Thank the Twelve that you arrived when you did.
2036,I can fight no further. Forgive me...
2037,I am blessed by the almighty Ifrit!
2038,Your fall will be swift!
2039,I hear the feeble sputtering of your spirit's flames!
2040,Target acquired! Ready cannons!
2041,"Ah, she purrs like a cat!"
2042,"Hmph, just a bunch of floating cabbages!"
2043,Eorzean savages!
2044,Thou shalt pay dearly for thine intrusion!
2045,Thy kind are not welcome here!
2046,The flames shall consume thee!
2047,"Hope to prevail, featherless ones cannot!"
2048,"Garuda's leal servant, you shall become!"
2049,"Futile, resistance is!"
2050,No one interrupts the coming of the Lord of Crags!
2051,Your bones will adorn Titan's earthen domain!
2052,Filthy overdweller!
2053,Pshhh... Finleshhh ones will not leave this place alive!
2054,Begone as foam upon the waves!
2055,Your shhhouls shall be given to the abyshhh!
2056,"You called, boss?"
2057,I must be home soon.
2058,My sisters will be sick with worry.
2059,The Springs are not far now...
2060,Pray wait a moment...
2061,Aaah!
2062,"Aid me, adventurer!"
2063,"Voco, prince of chocobos, at your service!"
2064,Let us be off! Kweeeh!
2065,We have a Chosen One to save!
2066,"Not so fast, <hex:020815E905FF09>Mistress<hex:FF07>Master<hex:03>! Voco's legs tire!"
2067,Kweh! Kweh!
2068,"Voco is a brave bird, oh yes!"
2069,"I'll save you, kupo!"
2070,"Your Grace, we beseech you! Save us in our hour of need, kupo!"
2071,"Just hold still, kupooo... "
2072,This'll put some spring into your step!
2073,"Your Grace, your Mogglesguard is nearly undone! Save us, kupo! Save us!"
2074,"You brought this on yourself, kupo!"
2075,"You should never have come here, kupo!"
2076,An ally of the Brotherhood!?
2077,Interfering gnat!
2078,The Flamefangs rule this land!
2079,You will all be slaves!
2080,Death to those who resist!
2081,Lord Ifrit is almighty!
2082,My spear craves your cries!
2083,"Do you bite, little desert fly?"
2084,All will bow before us!
2085,My fists are blessed by flame!
2086,Such feeble attacks!
2087,We are the masters of Thanalan!
2088,No ones shall pass!
2089,The podling belongs to these ones!
2090,Enemy of boss one is enemy of these ones.
2091,Meddling ones' bones will litter the forest!
2092,Tee hee! So much fun to kill walking ones!

2094,"Look upon this one, and fear!"
2095,Chosen One belongs with this one!

2125,"Zo Ga wants these tunnels clean, and what Zo Ga says, goes."
2126,Ye'll not leave these tunnels alive.
2127,The enemy of Zo Ga is my enemy.
2128,I'll bore a hole in yer bloody chest.

2385,Note that your chocobo's stamina will decrease more quickly when accelerating.
2386,Be warned─chocobos pushed too hard will become <hex:024804F201F403><hex:024904F201F503>lathered<hex:0249020103><hex:0248020103> and lose stamina even more quickly!
2387,"Next, practice steering your chocobo."
2388,Scattered throughout the course are <hex:024804F201F403><hex:024904F201F503>magicked panels<hex:0249020103><hex:0248020103> which bestow various effects when triggered.
2389,"Your chocobo gained a temporary burst of speed! However, be warned: not all panels bestow beneficial effects!"
2390,"In addition to magicked panels, you may come across treasure coffers containing <hex:024804F201F403><hex:024904F201F503>race items<hex:0249020103><hex:0248020103>."
2391,"Race items will be added to your hotbar automatically, and can be used to help yourself or hinder your opponents."
2392,Watch carefully and make the routine your own!
2393,"If you are uncertain as to how to perform, might I suggest pairing with another <hex:020948E948FF07>Hyuran<hex:FF07>Elezen<hex:FF09>Lalafell<hex:FF08>Miqo'te<hex:FF09>Roegadyn<hex:FF06>Au Ra<hex:FF09>Hrothgar<hex:FF06>Viera<hex:03>?"

2409,Here you can practice the basics of chocobo racing.
2410,"Continue to accelerate and observe the effects. Once your chocobo's stamina is completely depleted, your speed will drop, and you will no longer be able to accelerate."
2411,"To alleviate this condition, press the <hex:024804F201F403><hex:024904F201F503>Move Back<hex:0249020103><hex:0248020103> key to decelerate and allow your chocobo to rest."

2413,"To trigger a magicked panel, steer your chocobo towards it."
2414,"In addition to steering away from panels, you can also <hex:024804F201F403><hex:024904F201F503>jump<hex:0249020103><hex:0248020103> to avoid them."
2415,"Some treasure coffers will be suspended in midair, so to obtain the race items within, you will need to jump."
2416,This concludes the chocobo racing training course.
2417,You may repeat this course at any time should you wish to review the fundamentals.

2902,For the Nest!
2903,What the Fury's<hex:02100103>name is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
2904,Mark my words! They<hex:02100103>won't be coming back again!
2905,The lord commander<hex:02100103>will be sorely displeased...
2906,Form a wedge!
2907,Darkscale. You have no place here.
2908,"Silence, traitor! It is <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> who are guilty of trespass!"
2909,Your crimes against kith and kin are unforgivable. You shall be made to pay.
2910,"Not this day, old one!"
2911,Never have I seen a sloth<hex:02100103>move with such swiftness!
2912,Did you see the fear in<hex:02100103>that dragon's ugly face as<hex:02100103>my arrow pierced its neck?
2913,You mean that dragon<hex:021A020203>ling<hex:021A020103>?
2914,What!? Do I detect a hint<hex:02100103>of jealousy in your voice?
2915,Jealous that you stabbed<hex:02100103>an injured dragonling in the<hex:02100103>back while it was passed out?
2916,"That glory is all<hex:02100103>yours, my brother."
2917,How dare you try and<hex:02100103>lessen the glory I have<hex:02100103>brought to all Convictors!
2918,Whereas you have brought<hex:02100103>us nothing but shame!
2919,The Convictors will<hex:02100103>suffer you no longer!
2920,You would dare attack<hex:02100103>a brother unprovoked!?
2921,Swear you will no longer<hex:02100103>sully our order's name!
2922,Alright! You have my word!
2923,How could I...
2924,The captain will<hex:02100103>hear of this affront!
2925,"Kneel, dirty scoundrel!"
2926,"Not as easy a mark as<hex:02100103>a dying dragon pup, am I?"
2927,"Using an outsider to fight<hex:02100103>your own battles? Tell me,<hex:02100103>where is the glory in that!?"
2928,The killing blow was mine!<hex:02100103>Even you cannot deny that!
2929,Hah!
2930,"You're too slow, Beaudonet!"
2931,Too long did we wait...<hex:02100103>Too strong have you become...
2932,I cannot fall!<hex:02100103>I am immortal...!
2933,"Curse you, champion of Hydaelyn..."
2934,"The morning star riseth in the east, granting me strength!"
2935,"The malefic descendeth in the west, granting me knowledge!"
2936,"The benefic shineth in the south, granting me life!"
2937,"The pole star shineth in the north, granting me dominion!"
2938,I...I am spent...
2939,Remember to ware the butt!
2940,"Have at it, then!"
2941,I leave him in<hex:02100103>your capable hands.
2942,Impressive for one all but forgotten.
2943,Yet you turn to the sons of man for aid.
2944,Have you no pride?
2945,"Pride is the sin which blackens your heart, Darkscale."
2946,You fight with fire!
2947,I fight with a purpose.
2948,To make peace with the sons of man?
2949,Those who will only betray you again?
2950,"This is not the end, Vedrfolnir."
2951,"Now what will I wear<hex:02100103>to the big pomfire, kupo?"
2952,Something big and<hex:02100103>hungry this way comes!
2953,Ku...po... Kup...o...
2954,Ku...po?
2955,Po...po...popo...kupo...
2956,Why won't he just listen...?
2957,"I beg of you, kind land-<hex:02100103>lord! He must be stopped!"
2958,Mogoosh will be<hex:02100103>the end of us all!
2959,"He cannot be allowed<hex:02100103>to carry on like this, kupo!"
2960,My father will<hex:02100103>hear of this affront.
2961,"Hear me, my children! I return to Tharl Oom Khash!"
2962,See that the traitor cannot follow!
2963,"You will not escape so easily, Darkscale!"
2964,"As you command, my lord."
2965,We shall paint Zenith red with their lifeblood.
2966,A traitor has no place above Sohm Al!
2967,We shall cast your bones from her summit!
2968,Nidhogg has poisoned the minds of so many...
2969,How soon you forget the betrayal. It has been but a thousand short years!
2970,"I have not forgotten, but I have forgiven!"
2971,The traitor does not falter.
2972,"We must needs end this quickly. Come, my brothers!"
2973,Forgive me...my lord...
2974,I shall await you...in Sohm Al...
2975,It appears weakness is<hex:02100103>my greatest weakness...
2976,"And to think, the<hex:02100103>day began so well..."
2977,A fine day to<hex:02100103>rest and reflect.
2978,"Another boring day in the<hex:02100103>Mists, kupo. There has to<hex:02100103>be something fun to do..."
2979,Hm...?
2980,"Kupo, kupo,<hex:02100103>and off we go!"
2981,"We made it, kupo!"
2982,"Look! A flower, kupo!<hex:02100103>Isn't it beautiful!?"
2983,Might we rest a spell?<hex:02100103>My wings are exhausted!
2984,"This is a nice spot, kupo."
2985,"Almost there, kupo!"
2986,Kupopopo!
2987,"Maybe my friends were<hex:02100103>right to stay home, kupo..."
2988,"I'm not afraid, kupo...<hex:02100103>Honest!"
2989,"Don't eat me! Don't eat<hex:02100103>me! Don't eat me, kupo!"
2990,"Children of the land,<hex:02100103>answer my plea!"
2991,Mine uncle is this way.
2992,It appears he<hex:02100103>still has strength.
2993,"However, it fades fast.<hex:02100103>Prithee lend him aid!"
2994,Uncle... Wait for me<hex:02100103>in Sohm Al...
2995,<roar>
2996,I am a rock!<hex:02100103>I will not budge!
2997,Who wants to die next!?
2998,Uncle! You are safe!
2999,"So, it was you who<hex:02100103>summoned help."
3000,"I thank you, <hex:020818E905FF0C>daughter of<hex:FF07>son of<hex:03><hex:02100103>man. Your bravery will<hex:02100103>not soon be forgotten."
3001,I have a feeling we<hex:02100103>will meet again soon!
3002,Out of my way!
3003,Enough!
3004,Begone!
3005,"Thank you! But now I<hex:02100103>have to clean this<hex:02100103>whole tower myself, kupo..."
3006,I cannot watch!
3007,Feel our power!
3008,Know our wrath!
3009,<pant> <pant><hex:02100103>Are we safe here...?
3010,Kweeeh!
3011,Wark...
3012,Kweh! Kweh!
3013,"You will go no further, traitors."
3014,Your every move is known to me.
3015,I will rip the limbs from you and feast on your entrails!
3016,Curses! An ambush!
3017,And to think we were so close to Zenith...!
3018,Resistance is futile.
3019,Gahahaha! I will lick the flesh from your bones!
3020,Is this the end for us...?
3021,I thought I heard the sounds of fighting...
3022,"How fare you, my young ones?"
3023,Lord Vedrfolnir!<hex:02100103>Your presence heartens us all!
3024,"Well, look who joins the fray..."
3025,You will die with your precious younglings!
3026,This isn't our day...
3027,Fall back!
3028,"You fought well, young ones."
3029,It was by your strength that we prevailed.
3030,"We have won the day, but there is no knowing when our foe will return."
3031,Let us return to Zenith together.
3032,"We would be honored to, my lord."
3033,This is the fate of a traitor!
3034,We have done our duty here. Let us away!
3035,You are so quick to retreat?
3036,This battle was but a warning.
3037,"I care not whether you live or die, so long as you suffer."
3038,"You have suffered, and suffered well. Gahahaha!"
3039,Our foe's true target is Zenith...<hex:02100103>We must alert the others!
3040,Forgive me...
3041,I pray I am not<hex:02100103>discovered...
3042,Do not draw<hex:02100103>them here...
3043,Steel yourself!<hex:02100103>They come!
3044,What!? Th-There<hex:02100103>are so many!
3045,This is beyond me...
3046,I shall leave it in<hex:02100103>your capable hands.
3047,"Live today, fight<hex:02100103>tomorrow..."
3048,"You fought well,<hex:02100103><hex:020812E905FF09>daughter<hex:FF04>son<hex:03> of the Land.<hex:02100103>My thanks to you."
3049,Till we meet again.
3050,This does not look good for us...
3051,Retreat at once!
3052,Aye!
3053,Pathetic...
3054,It gladdens me to see you safe.
3055,To Zenith! Fly!
3056,Understood!
3057,"Someone save me, kupo!"
3058,"Now would be a good time to run, kupo."
3059,We settle this!
3060,Prepare yourselves!
3061,Tch...! This is not going as I hoped...
3062,Killing is fine sport. Being killed...not so much.
3063,"You have amused me for the day, my quarry."
3064,"But know this: I am ever the hunter, and you the hunted."
3065,We're saved!
3066,"I am saved, kupo!"
3067,"Flutter all you like, little one..."
3068,It will only make killing you all the sweeter!
3069,"No! I'm too cute to die, kupo!"
3070,What is this? My prey comes to me?
3071,This should be good sport!
3072,"Yes, I shall slaughter the lot of you!"
3073,You will be my next plaything...
3074,My prey bites back? How...amusing.
3075,My playthings of late have proven far too...fragile.
3076,I have not enjoyed myself so thoroughly in quite some time.
3077,"But there is more fun to be had, yes?"
3078,"Ahhh, the thrill of the hunt!"
3079,A savage battle to the death!
3080,The pain! The blood! The pleasure!
3081,"Is that all you have? Come! Come, I say!"
3082,"It's as if the sight of blood urges him on, kupo!"
3083,"Who are you calling “prey”!?<hex:02100103>I'm no one's dinner, kupo!"
3084,"This one's not right in the head, kupo!"
3085,"Come back, little one..."
3086,"At last, Zenith!"
3087,"Come forth, my minions!"
3088,Pull yourself together!
3089,Focus...release!
3090,Away with you!
3091,I have my pride...
3092,For the house of Leveilleur!
3093,Thaliak protect me!
3094,So it comes to this!
3095,A godsdamned joke...
3096,"Take this, you bastard!"
3097,How about this!?
3098,Accursed heathens!
3099,"Bless me, O Fury!"
3100,I've got you now!
3101,Hells take you!
3102,I will not yield to you!
3103,I'll cut you to pieces!
3104,Enough!
3105,Hahaha!
3106,This ends here!
3107,Down with you!
3108,I have the power!
3109,Who dares interfere?
3110,I will not be shown up by a mortal!
3111,Perfect... These ones should make a good sacrifice.
3112,These ones will play with you next.
3113,Again? Are you good for nothing!?
3114,What say you to this?
3115,"Stand down, fiend!"
3116,The traitor cometh.
3117,Mark my words─your end is nigh.
3118,"My minions, I leave the whelps to you."
3119,"They, too, have fallen?"
3120,And here I thought they would prove more useful...
3121,You are next! Do not fail me!
3122,Is there no end to the dishonor you bring me!?
3123,Pathetic...all of you.
3124,So be it. It appears I have no choice.
3125,"Come, my faithful!"
3126,It is nothing.
3127,An opening!
3128,Your defense is lacking.
3129,Leave this to me!
3130,The weave of a shinobi's power!
3131,"No retreat, no surrender!"
3132,The art of my forebears!
3133,To bring down a foe of such power...
3134,"Your strength is great indeed, mortal."
3135,My minions have fallen...?
3136,You fight well for a miserable traitor.
3137,...But this is not the end.
3138,The day we next meet shall be your last.
3139,You would flee?
3140,"For all his bluster, he is but a craven snake."
3141,The next time I shall give him the death he deserves.
3142,I'm not finished yet!
3143,How do you like this!?
3144,Yaaaaaargh!
3145,I'll make you bleed!
3146,For Ala Mhigo!
3147,I'll tear you limb from limb!
3148,I have you now!
3149,Yoyoroon love loots!<hex:02100103>Loots loots loots!♪
3150,A roar from the heavens...!
3151,Darkscale... Darkscale calls...
3152,Your death shall come another day...
3153,"Consider yourselves fortunate, traitorous worms..."
3154,"Wait, coward!"
3155,"When next we meet, I will show no quarter!"
3156,You are no match for my minions!
3157,You're first!
3158,"My thanks, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!<hex:02100103>I am at your back!"
3159,Darkscale! I have cornered you at last.
3160,Your captains have all fallen to me.
3161,"Now, you will join them!"
3162,"...“Cornered,” you say?"
3163,"Look around you, fool."
3164,This is my lair...and I have lured you into it.
3165,You will not leave this place alive!
3166,You are a worthy foe...for a traitor.
3167,"Face the truth, Darkscale! You are beaten!"
3168,Beaten? I think not...
3169,Behold!!!
3170,"O, Nidhogg! Give unto me your strength!"
3171,The air stirs...?
3172,The crystals...! He drinks of their power!
3173,The fire! It wells from within!
3174,Now I shall smite you like the worm you are!
3175,I cannot fall to this traitor...!
3176,I must have more power!
3177,"You know not what you do, Darkscale!<hex:02100103>The power you seek will destroy you!"
3178,"Silence, fool!"
3179,Gladly would I give my life in service to my lord!
3180,I must have more power! MORE!!!
3181,GWAHAHAHA!!!
3182,I AM INVINCIBLE!
3183,No words will reach him now...
3184,Steel yourself. We face a desperate foe.
3185,"COME, AND I SHALL SMITE YOU!"
3186,How can this be!?
3187,"Such power is mine, and still the traitor does not fall!"
3188,I must have more strength...
3189,Give unto me the power...!
3190,Give unto me all there is to give!
3191,"You only hasten your own demise, Darkscale!"
3192,GRAHAHAHA... I HAVE DRUNK MY FILL.
3193,He has exceeded his physical limits.
3194,What drives him to such madness...?
3195,"COME, TRAITOR!!!<hex:02100103>I SHALL TEAR THE WINGS FROM YOUR BACK!!!"
3196,MY CLAWS SHALL RIP THE SCALES FROM YOUR FLESH AS MY FIRE CHARS YOUR CORPSE TO A SHRIVELED HUSK!!!
3197,"YOU WILL BURN, VEDRFOLNIR! BURN!!!"
3198,"Alas, the proud dragon who once lived is now gone..."
3199,"Consumed by power and hate, he is but a machine of destruction now."
3200,"Join me, mortal, and let us put Darkscale out of his misery!"
3201,THIS CANNOT BE!
3202,"I AM DARKSCALE, GENERAL OF NIDHOGG!<hex:02100103>I WILL NOT FALL TO THIS TRAITOR!"
3203,I MUST HAVE MORE POWER...! More...power...
3204,...It is over.
3205,"I take no joy in Darkscale's end, but at last, these halls will know peace again."
3206,I must return to Zenith.
3207,"Till we meet again, O hero among mortals."
3208,My claws! My precious adamantite claws!<hex:02100103>Look what you've done to them!
3209,"Oh, you'll pay! Don't think<hex:02100103>that you won't pay!"
3210,Philistine!
3211,"For your wanton destruction,<hex:02100103>I sentence you to death!"
3212,How dare you!
3213,Our foe is strong...
3214,...and his power grows with each passing moment.
3215,"But if not I, who shall defend the spire!?"
3216,"Yes, I must fight on!"
3217,I will not abandon those who suffer at Darkscale's ravaging claws!
3218,It does not even scathe him...? Inconceivable!
3219,Do we battle in vain...?
3220,No! I will not fall to this fiend who casts away his pride!
3221,I must prevail!
3222,Even if I must give my life in the trying!
3223,Have I...failed?
3224,His power... It was too great...
3225,Forgive me...my lord...
3226,GRAHAHAHA!
3227,YOU DIE AS YOU LIVED─A TRAITOR!
3228,NOW YOUR FOUL BROOD WILL FEEL MY FLAMES!
3229,"KNOW YOUR TRUE LORD, DRAGONLINGS! AND FEAR HIM!"
3230,"This looks as good<hex:02100103>a place as any, I reckon."
3231,What in the seven hells?
3232,Blimey!<hex:02100103>Bloody brown bears!
3233,"Please, <hex:020813E905FF07>milady<hex:FF07>milord<hex:03>! I beg ye!<hex:02100103>Drive the beasts afield!"
3234,The salmon...<hex:02100103>I'm doomed...
3235,Now if I can just catch<hex:02100103>something...anything.
3236,The wife'll have me<hex:02100103>head if I come home<hex:02100103>without a catch.
3237,All this thrashin' about...<hex:02100103>There won't be a fish<hex:02100103>left in the entire river!
3238,"Bite, godsdamn you! Bite!"
3239,Ugh... You are strong...
3240,"The day is yours, but you have not seen the last of me."
3241,You would flee?
3242,You are a craven and a traitor both!
3243,"When next we meet, you will not leave with your life."
3244,We have only just begun!
3245,You'll not best me so easily!
3246,I will kill you if it is the last thing I do!
3247,Vileki─ No... Those aren't<hex:02100103>vilekin... They're...
3248,Gaelicats!<hex:02100103>Scores of them!
3249,Twelve help us! They've<hex:02100103>come for the bloody mint!
3250,"Keep that mint safe,<hex:02100103>or we'll be elbow-deep<hex:02100103>in vilekin as well!"
3251,The mint has sent the<hex:02100103>things into a right frenzy!
3252,Might serve us better if<hex:02100103>we tossed the mint back<hex:02100103>down to Ishgard...
3253,At least they won't<hex:02100103>be coming back?
3254,What's that smell...?
3255,By the Fury! Giant leeches!
3256,I think I'm done for...
3257,"Somebody, anybody!"
3258,"Thanks for the help,<hex:02100103>mysterious stranger!"
3259,What a horrid experience...
3260,
3261,
3262,Oi! Gundu! The whole bloody<hex:02100103>lot of you are cravens!
3263,Bowing and scraping for your<hex:02100103>Vundu masters! How pathetic!
3264,Like furious summer squall I<hex:02100103>piss on the Gundu! Hear me!?<hex:02100103>I piss on you!
3265,Foul-mouthed netherling!<hex:02100103>Show yourself!
3266,Piss on Gundu!?<hex:02100103>Gundu piss on your corpse!
3267,"As surely as sun rises and sets,<hex:02100103>Gundu find and punish netherling!"
3268,"Begone, dark ones!<hex:02100103>These lands belong to Vundu!"
3269,Meddlesome as gaelicats!<hex:02100103>Kill them all! Kill them all!
3270,"Netherling is strong, like a<hex:02100103>dragon without wings."
3271,The skies grow dark...<hex:02100103>Kena Vanu will fight<hex:02100103>another day.
3272,"As sure as the night swallows<hex:02100103>the sun, your time will come..."
3273,"For Kena Vanu, Vundu<hex:02100103>would cast himself into<hex:02100103>the swirling winds!"
3274,Netherling will pay for<hex:02100103>sullying the white of the<hex:02100103>clouds─in blood!
3275,Infidels! You will suffer<hex:02100103>the divine judgment of<hex:02100103>the White!
3276,To stand against Kena Vanu<hex:02100103>is as a minnow baring its<hex:02100103>teeth against the White.
3277,"Come, Skvader! Crush<hex:02100103>these netherlings like<hex:02100103>gastornis eggs!"
3278,"The sun shall soon<hex:02100103>set on you, netherling!"
3279,This island will fall from<hex:02100103>the sky before a netherling<hex:02100103>defeats Kena Vanu!
3280,Foolish netherling!<hex:02100103>Drink from the rains<hex:02100103>of despair!
3281,You'll not interfere again!
3282,Have you not had enough?
3283,The true battle begins now!
3284,"Your reckoning is nigh, traitor!"
3285,This bodes ill...
3286,"No, it will not end like this!"
3287,You shall join me in the abyss!
3288,
3289,
3290,"My, such feisty prey!"
3291,You lust for blood? I shall give it to you!
3292,There is no greater thrill than the hunt!
3293,"Yesss, this is what I live for!"
3294,Hahaha! I love it!
3295,Nothing stirs the blood like struggling prey!
3296,
3297,
3298,
3299,Confound it...
3300,That I should be pressed so by their ilk...
3301,I had not reckoned upon this...
3302,"No, I cannot fall..."
3303,"Not here, not yet..."
3304,I must regather my strength...
3305,Fly like the craven you are!
3306,"Know your folly, traitor!"
3307,This bores me.
3308,They were persistent if naught else.
3309,We have wasted enough time here.
3310,Darkscale is headed for Tharl Oom Khash.
3311,Let us go and settle this once and for all!
3312,"Come, my young ones.<hex:02100103>I will tend to your wounds."
3313,To think that one of your kind could boast the strength to fell Nidhogg's trusted general...
3314,"You intrigue me, mortal."
3315,"You are strong, yes!"
3316,Yet you have not tapped the depths of your potential!
3317,Show me the strength by which you did slay the mighty Darkscale!
3318,Yes! I knew that it was so...
3319,"The power ensconced within you is great indeed, mortal..."
3320,"Yes, the power to make even a mighty dragon tremble..."
3321,"I would see you harness your power to its limits, and beyond!"
3322,"There is more power in you yet, mortal!"
3323,Impressive!
3324,They're all over me!
3325,They're gone...<hex:02100103>They're finally gone!
3326,That's it. I'm movin'<hex:02100103>to Falcon's Nest!
3327,The damned things'll<hex:02100103>suck me dry!
3328,"I've been cursed,<hex:02100103>I tell ye!"
3329,Find a bloody chocobo's<hex:02100103>arse to suckle! 
3330,Just keep 'em away...
3331,I don't know how to<hex:02100103>thank ye! Here's the<hex:02100103>coin I promised.
3332,<click> <click><hex:02100103>All is well.
3333,What!? Miacids!?<hex:02100103>All is <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103> well!
3334,The vile fiends are<hex:02100103>befouling the river!

3338,"<click> <click><hex:02100103>You win this day, miacids.<hex:02100103>But the war is not over..."
3339,"<click> <click><hex:02100103>Befoul our river, will you!?"
3340,"They are many, but we are strong!"
3341,<click> <click>
3342,M-My lady!
3343,<click> <click><hex:02100103>I grow weak. I go to inform the others.
3344,Carry on in my stead if you can...
3345,<click> <click><hex:02100103>Look! Fresh meat.
3346,The hunt begins.
3347,"Tonight, we feast!"
3348,<click> <click><hex:02100103>Pull back! Pull back!
3349,It will not suffice...
3350,"Meat, meat, meat..."
3351,<click> <click><hex:02100103>There is no escape.
3352,<click> <click>
3353,<click> <click><hex:02100103>This one is ready.
3354,<click> <click><hex:02100103>All will fall!
3355,"<click> <click><hex:02100103>Meat, meat, meat!"
3356,This should provide adequate sustenance.
3357,<click> <click><hex:02100103>For shame.
3358,<click> <click><hex:02100103>Hunting is hard.
3359,<click> <click><hex:02100103>It hurts us so...
3360,<click> <click><hex:02100103>More practice is required.
3361,<click> <click><hex:02100103>Surrender your flesh.
3362,<click> <click>
3363,For the nourishment of our bodies...
3364,Netherling fells my Skvader!<hex:02100103>Rage swirls within me like a storm!
3365,"Gwahahaha!<hex:02100103>Bow before the White, netherling."
3366,"How dare you, netherling!?"
3367,My name is Ultima...
3368,I am power both ancient and unrivaled...
3369,"I do not bleed, for I am but strength given form..."
3370,Feeble creatures of flesh... Your time is nigh!
3371,Coeurls!? Here!?
3372,We must drive them away!
3373,Wh-What in the seven<hex:02100103>hells is that thing!?
3374,It's...it's massive!
3375,Heeelp!
3376,Mammy!
3377,Illuminati not soon<hex:02100103>un-remember this!
3378,Rain of shame floods<hex:02100103>gobbie goggles...
3379,"All gob, backfall!"
3380,Readymake<hex:02100103>secret doom!
3381,There she is!
3382,Fill her with arrows!
3383,Kweeeh!
3384,Kweh! Kweh!
3385,Kweh...!?
3386,We'll be back! You can't<hex:02100103>watch the whole forest!
3387,"This one'll fetch<hex:02100103>a fine price, I reckon!"
3388,I'll slice you up and<hex:02100103>feed you to the bears!
3389,Don't you move!
3390,I've seen baby chocobos<hex:02100103>put up more fight!
3391,Bleedin' 'venturers!
3392,Hah hah! If I don't eat<hex:02100103>her first! Hah hah hah!
3393,"If ye see her,<hex:02100103>grab her!"
3394,Where's she hidin' now?
3395,I can smell her!
3396,I will not yield!
3397,Your guard is down!
3398,Know your folly!
3399,Taste my lance!
3400,I will end your struggles!
3401,By the power of the Eye!
3402,You are outmatched!
3403,Begin the search!
3404,Spread out!
3405,Leave no stone unturned!
3406,Have you found anything?
3407,Keep your eyes open!
3408,There is nothing here.
3409,Call for reinforcements!
3410,Drop your weapons and<hex:02100103>you'll receive a swift death!
3411,Ngah!
3412,Fall back to the <hex:021A020203>Gration<hex:021A020103>!
3413,Maintain your lines!
3414,The Eorzeans<hex:02100103>will pay for this!
3415,Stay alert! The enemy<hex:02100103>may still lurk nearby.
3416,Do not forget<hex:02100103>why we are here.
3417,I think I may have found<hex:02100103>something! Or not...
3418,To think a mortal could wield such might!
3419,"Truly, there is no limit to your powers."
3420,"This battle is not over yet.<hex:02100103>No, I have only scratched the surface of my strength..."
3421,"That is enough, mortal."
3422,You are possessed of great power─and the strength of will to control it.
3423,It was an honor and a pleasure to meet you on the battlefield.
3424,"Farewell, hero among mortals. I will remember you."
3425,"You disappoint me, mortal."
3426,"I saw great promise, great strength in you."
3427,"Alas, it seems that I was mistaken..."
3428,"Who dares disturb─? Oho, it is you."
3429,I daresay this encounter is no mere chance.
3430,"If you would test your strength against me, I would be honored to meet your challenge!"
3431,Nothing to report.
3432,Sector clear!
3433,Not a soul for malms.
3434,Seize <hex:02080DE905FF04>her<hex:FF04>him<hex:03>!
3435,Where did <hex:02080CE905FF04>she<hex:FF03>he<hex:03> come from!?
3436,Leave no survivors!
3437,Regroup and fall back!
3438,Leave the wounded!
3439,There will be more. Do<hex:02100103>not let down your guard!
3440,We lay claim to this land<hex:02100103>in the name of the Emperor!
3441,The enemy<hex:02100103>could be anywhere.
3442,There's nothing out here.
3443,I thought I<hex:02100103>heard something.
3444,Submit!
3445,You stand in the<hex:02100103>way of progress!
3446,"Alive or dead,<hex:02100103>the legatus cares not."
3447,Controlled retreat!<hex:02100103>Double time!
3448,We will have to<hex:02100103>report this to the legatus!
3449,Threat neutralized.
3450,Continue survey<hex:02100103>of the area.
3451,Illuminati brainfruit<hex:02100103>is frontmost! Brings much<hex:02100103>blastydoom to enemy!

3463,Oh dear...
3464,Filthy rats!
3465,Sickness must be purged!
3466,Begone with you!
3467,And now the final curtain!
3468,You disgust me!
3469,This shall be a mercy!
3470,"Oh, bugger..."
3471,Is that all you've got!?
3472,I see you!
3473,That's far enough!
3474,Let's finish it!
3475,Riiight there!
3476,"One shot, one kill!"
3477,Hold fast!
3478,Come!
3479,Have at thee!
3480,Bear witness!
3481,Halone guide my sword!
3482,I shall show you something special!
3483,For the honor of House Fortemps!
3484,This is not over!
3485,Haaah!
3486,Yaaah!
3487,I shall make it quick!
3488,Have at you!
3489,"Aether, to me!"
3490,Fall!
3491,Zundu must flee this place<hex:02100103>on the wings of the wind!
3492,Zundu legs are as<hex:02100103>heavy as tree trunks!
3493,Be wary! Cruel Vundu<hex:02100103>trail us like a shadow.
3494,Vundu surround us<hex:02100103>like a choking fog!
3495,"Zundu feels hope, like a ray<hex:02100103>of sun to chase the night!"
3496,My homeland greets my eyes<hex:02100103>like a rainbow on the horizon!
3497,Such treachery! Like a dark<hex:02100103> cloud on a summer's day!
3498,"At last, the storm is over<hex:02100103>and blue skies return!"
3499,Here Zundu is safe as a<hex:02100103>bird in its mother's breast.
3500,"Netherling is strong as wind,<hex:02100103>and gentle as the kiss of<hex:02100103>the morning dew."
3501,Zundu remember your<hex:02100103>kindness for many<hex:02100103>summers to come.
3502,Zundu feels a presence<hex:02100103>behind like storm clouds<hex:02100103>on the horizon.
3503,"Zundu hears voices, like<hex:02100103>the whispers of the rain."
3504,Zundu tires of being Vundu<hex:02100103>footrest. Zundu just wants<hex:02100103>to go home.
3505,"The beasts come,<hex:02100103>roaring in like a tempest!"
3506,"Vundu come, on angry<hex:02100103>wings of thunder!"
3507,What is this? Am I saved?
3508,"My brother, you look as if<hex:02100103>battered by raging winds."
3509,"Oh, what fortune! Like a ray<hex:02100103>of sun breaking through the<hex:02100103>clouds, you are!"
3510,"My brother, your heart<hex:02100103>seems as restless as<hex:02100103>the stormy seas."
3511,Were you perhaps chased<hex:02100103>here by the cruel Vundu?
3512,"Worry not, for I shall guide you<hex:02100103>home on a gentle breeze..."
3513,"Come, and take shelter<hex:02100103>under my wing..."
3514,"Thank you, brother!<hex:02100103>My heart shines like the sun!"
3515,"Your breathing grows heavy,<hex:02100103>brother. Let us rest here."
3516,...Ahhh. The rest refreshes<hex:02100103>me like a mountain spring.
3517,"Thank you, brother. Now let us<hex:02100103>be off before the storms come."
3518,Why rush? I see no<hex:02100103>clouds on the horizon.
3519,(Curses! What is<hex:02100103>keeping them...?)
3520,"You speak, brother?"
3521,N-No! It was just the<hex:02100103>rustling of the wind.
3522,There he is!
3523,Finally! I thought spring might<hex:02100103>come before you arrived!
3524,Foolish Zundu. Time to<hex:02100103>return and fulfill your fate<hex:02100103>as a footstool.
3525,What!? I have been deceived!?
3526,Hah! Gullible as a fledgling.
3527,You have escaped Vundu<hex:02100103>clutches for the last time.
3528,Help! Someone help me!
3529,"Proud, peaceful Zundu is<hex:02100103>not a piece of furniture!"
3530,Netherling is a ray of light<hex:02100103>in Zundu's darkest hour.
3531,I must hurry back to<hex:02100103>Ok' Zundu like the wind...
3532,...and tell my brothers<hex:02100103>of this Vundu treachery.
3533,"Oh, woe! Is there no<hex:02100103>end to my dark days?"
3534,Movement detected<hex:02100103>nearby. Weapons ready!
3535,Something watches us!
3536,There are tracks<hex:02100103>leading this direction!
3537,Your orders are to<hex:02100103>take no survivors!
3538,Try and escape!
3539,You won't leave<hex:02100103>this place alive!
3540,These are the coordinates.
3541,Back to your stations!
3542,Toss the bodies<hex:02100103>over the edge.
3543,The retreat is sounded!<hex:02100103>Fall back! Fall back!
3544,Bask in the master's glory!
3545,All for Tarasque!<hex:02100103>All for Tarasque!
3546,This one shall make<hex:02100103>a fine offering!
3547,"These whizzlepops...<hex:02100103>Oh, my gob!"
3548,Uplander must make<hex:02100103>swiftheels with Slicktrix!
3549,Shkohhh! Have<hex:02100103>wariness muchly!
3550,Enemy comes!
3551,Stronger enemy comes!
3552,Strongerer<hex:02100103>enemy comes!
3553,Something is<hex:02100103>very unright!
3554,Can it be...!?
3555,W-Worrythoughts of<hex:02100103>Slicktrix is reality!
3556,New vangob is complete!<hex:02100103>Idyllshire is in danger!
3557,Shkohhh... Slicktrix must<hex:02100103>be telling shirefriends!
3558,Focusing energy.
3559,"With a spear as stiff<hex:02100103>as ice, I thrust!"
3560,"Like the majestic<hex:02100103>Coerthan puffer, I swell!"
3561,"Like the surging waters<hex:02100103>of the mighty Coerthas, I come!"
3562,Unauthorized temporal signature detected. Initiating elimination protocol.
3563,Whatever is keeping him?
3564,Flee! Flee for your lives!
3565,Enough games for today...
3566,"Die, damn you!"
3567,For the Lady!
3568,Meddler!
3569,You cannot stop us!
3570,"Well, well..."
3571,This one shall make<hex:02100103>an excellent offering.
3572,"Look closely, now."
3573,Kneel before me!
3574,There is no escape!
3575,Writhe and suffer!
3576,Ugh...
3577,So it comes to this.
3578,"Very well, if I must..."
3579,"My blood, my body,<hex:02100103>my soul─as one!"
3580,Bear witness to my ascension!
3581,Mwahahaha!
3582,It begins with your end!
3583,The blood! It burns!
3584,Grind their bones!
3585,Feast upon their flesh!
3586,Kill them all!
3587,Tailfeather shall burn...
3588,"Argh, it burns, it burns!"
3589,"Die, abomination!<hex:02100103>The Fury wills it!"
3590,Here they come!<hex:02100103>Protect the mint!
3591,Zundu wants for water as<hex:02100103>pure as the morning dew!
3592,Zundu is as busy as a whirlwind!<hex:02100103>Zundu wants for aid!
3593,"Like the clouds weep rain,<hex:02100103>Zundu cries for water!"
3594,There must be more<hex:02100103>around here somewhere...
3595,What I wouldn't give<hex:02100103>for a helping hand!
3596,Hm. I could do with a few more.
3597,These ought to do nicely!
3598,That was too close!<hex:02100103>Mayhap another time...
3599,Look out!<hex:02100103>Bandersnatches!
3600,Spare me no quarter!
3601,Unquenchable are my flames!
3602,What in the hells happened!?
3603,"Down, boy, down!"
3604,Bloody hells!
3605,It's out of control!
3606,Nothing to see here!
3607,Just a little...difficulty.
3608,There's no need to worry!
3609,What do we do!?
3610,I knew the beast wasn't ready!
3611,"Calm down, boy!"
3612,Thank heavens!
3613,Everyone's safe...
3614,Run away!
3615,"Everyone, away from the beach!"
3616,Gather 'round everyone!
3617,You won't believe your eyes!
3618,You'll be the envy of your friends!
3619,The show of a lifetime!
3620,The infernal contraptions are come!<hex:02100103>Let us eradicate this threat to Thanalan!
3621,Hearken to my words!<hex:02100103>Glory in the song of rebirth!
3622,We cannot allow these fiends to mar the celebrations!
3623,This is an infestation...<hex:02100103>Mayhap I should have brought more arrows!
3624,"We must stem this cold, metal tide!"
3625,They swarm in such numbers...<hex:02100103>'Tis time for the stirring climax.
3626,Be smote by mine resolve!
3627,0
3628,Do not let them...overrun the land...
3629,My strength fails me...
3630,Victory!<hex:02100103>The bugs will not soon recover from this slaughter.
3631,"Thank you, adventurer.<hex:02100103>The field is ours this day!"
3632,Their numbers are too great...<hex:02100103>Let us fall back and regroup!
3633,The faire is here at last!

3643,0
3644,She looked at <hex:021A020203>me<hex:021A020103>!
3645,We must get closer!
3646,0
3647,Pray leave me be!
3648,You won't lay a finger on m'lady!
3649,"Bugger off, you curs!"
3650,Stay back!
3651,"I am yours, goddess!"
3652,Grace us with your gaze!
3653,Let us grovel at your feet!
3654,Don't forsake us!
3655,Oh no!
3656,"Please, help!"
3657,I just want to go to the faire...
3658,"Finally, I can enjoy the fireworks."
3659,"It's safe now, m'lady."
3660,"Goddess, please..."
3661,"Please, at least pat my head."
3662,Why must this always happen!?
3663,"M'lady, run!"
3664,Me first!
3665,I'll be her favorite!
3666,Such devotion...
3667,She will be mine!
3668,Such grace...
3669,I'm speechless...
3670,Protect...m'lady...
3671,Don't let her come to harm...
3672,Godsdammit...
3673,Why can Bugaal Ja not bathe at beach!?
3674,You've been banned from the beach!

3679,But you cannot stop dance! Never!

3693,Let the sparks fly!
3694,Are there no brave adventurers?
3695,Stop them!
3696,You've got guts!
3697,You'll regret this!
3698,The seas take you!
3699,Thank you! Our guests should be safe now.
3700,Enjoy the faire!
3701,We must inform the guild...
3702,Hahaha! Time for a celebration!
3703,Don't let us see you near here again!
3704,"I will bathe, and I will dance!"
3705,"Not here, you won't!"
3706,Why...why do you despise me so...?
3707,To dance...was all I wanted...
3708,"He's gone, finally."
3709,But I can't unsee his gyrations...
3710,Now you see the power of my dance!
3711,You are undeserving of my tradition!
3712,Godsdammit. At least he's gone.
3713,"If he returns, I may call on you again."
3714,You're a godssend!
3715,The beautiful beaches...
3716,Those pirates and their garbage!
3717,I can't pick these up alone.
3718,"Ah, much better!"
3719,"Godsdamn, we'll have to try something else..."
3720,We won't forget this! 
3721,Die!
3722,Hands off our grog!
3723,Ow...my head...
3724,The beach is ours!
3725,"So, how about it?"
3726,We've got plenty o' grog.
3727,One sip'll perk you right up.
3728,We can drink it right here.
3729,Now this is a faire!
3730,"Go on, get the grog!"
3731,Nothin' beats grog on the beach.
3732,"Come on, lass, I'll carry you."
3733,Get away!
3734,You reek of dead fish!
3735,What'd you say!?
3736,"Bloody feisty, they are!"
3737,Been itchin' for a little fun an' games!
3738,Get 'em!
3739,Get your hands away from me!
3740,"Someone, help!"
3741,Ahhh!
3742,You'll regret this!
3743,"Not the “fun” you had in mind, eh!?"
3744,Bend over and kiss your arse good-bye!
3745,How do you like ribs? Broken!?

3765,"No, it's a goddess!"
3766,"Gods be good, get the others!"
3767,Hurry up!
3768,My poor beast...
3769,We'll have to get another...
3770,What a bloody waste!
3771,We slaved away on those fireworks...
3772,Intruders! From above!

3812,Must hurry! Must hurry!
3813,Tear down the walls!
3814,By what unholy strength have we been bested...?
3815,This beach is somehow familiar...
3816,But there is no time for talk. The crabs come!
3817,I am reminded of a tale from long ago...
3818,...Of fledgling adventurers who would fight crabs like these to better themselves.
3819,I pray our training is as successful as theirs was.
3820,I believe that will suffice for now.
3821,Fighting alongside such a seasoned warrior has been educational.
3822,I am grateful that you chose to accompany me.
3823,Perhaps...<pant>...perhaps I was too ambitious...
3824,If only I had taken a proper meal beforehand...
3825,Practice makes perfect!
3826,Disgusting creatures!
3827,'Tis as if the very air is tainted by darkness...
3828,Minions of the Shadow Lord!? From whence did they come?
3829,These demons... They call to mind another old story.
3830,"To surpass his limits, a great samurai once fought such fiends..."
3831,Perhaps by defeating these demons I can do the same.
3832,It would seem we have driven them back.
3833,"Alas, I could scarcely match your pace. This will not do."
3834,There must be a way for me to improve more quickly...
3835,It would seem we have underestimated our enemy...
3836,But I cannot fail─not with so much at stake...
3837,Look! Over there! Could it be...?
3838,"I know that fiend. Those jagged pincers, dripping with venom..."
3839,"It is Serket, an infamous beast and slayer of countless men."
3840,Come! Let us bring an end to its legend and see ours grow in its wake!
3841,To think that we managed to defeat such a foe...
3842,And yet...I find that there is something within me still wanting.
3843,<sigh> I must find a way to overcome this. I must find my way home.
3844,To think...my strength would fail me at a time like this!
3845,I will not be denied. I <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> find my way back home!
3846,On your guard! I sense a dark presence...
3847,There! And it is not alone...
3848,But I am not alone either.
3849,I will deal with the dragon. Pray attend to the eye. 
3850,"I-I struck true, and yet...it is unharmed!?"
3851,I fear I am nearing my limit...
3852,No! I did not come this far to fail now! I <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> return to my world! 
3853,To Master...
3854,The power...it fills me!
3855,The power of Amatsu: Kyori!
3856,"Come, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>. It begins!"
3857,"At last, my training is complete. And it is all thanks to you."
3858,You were always there to keep me on the path.
3859,"I would speak with you more, but not here. Let us make for Limsa Lominsa."
3860,H-How could this be?
3861,I will not fall!
3862,Hyah!
3863,Take that!
3864,Hyaaa!
3865,Ever shall we rise!

3885,Lay down your arms or die by the sword!

3887,You underestimate me!
3888,This knight does not yield!
3889,Are they unharmed!?
3890,Fortemps!
3891,Death to the heretics!
3892,The Fury is with us!
3893,There will be others...
3894,"No, please!"

5129,What else could it be?
5130,"Whatever it is, it appears<hex:02100103>to be in ill repair."
5131,Do you think it safe<hex:02100103>to approach?
5132,Absolutely not! Gods know<hex:02100103>what manner of traps the<hex:02100103>enemy planted upon it!
5133,But perhaps there are<hex:02100103>parts worth salvaging.
5134,That can wait. We must<hex:02100103>first report this to camp.
5135,Come on. We march.

5175,Even the slightest rustle of<hex:02100103>the leaves could be an enemy<hex:02100103>in waiting.

5198,"You stay over <hex:021A020203>there<hex:021A020103>, okay?"
5199,Gah! A lucky guess!
5200,I wouldn't look too close if I were you!
5201,"Look away, I say!"
5202,It is as I said. The prey here<hex:02100103>is plentiful. But do not forget<hex:02100103>we walk on Oroniri soil.
5203,The steppe belongs to<hex:02100103>no man! We hunt where<hex:02100103>we please!

5205,Never!
5206,The wolves will feast tonight!
5207,You will stay off our lands<hex:02100103>or your children will meet<hex:02100103>the same grim fate!

5308,Time to dine!
5309,The bonfire is only escape!
5310,Though I'd be disappointed with aught less from the bloody hero of the realm!
5311,But what say we toss you a bone with a deal more meat on her? Officers! Form ranks!
5312,"Traveler. Please, I beg of you!"
5313,I don't like being followed.<hex:02100103>Name yourself!

5330,
5331,
5332,"Wait. If this machine can track<hex:02100103>us, then fleeing back to camp..."
5333,Would lead the enemy<hex:02100103>right where it wants to go! 
5334,Thal's bleeding balls!
5335,But if we can't go back...
5336,"Aw, hells no!"
5337,That was close...
5338,Are you injured?
5339,"I'm not dead, am I?"
5340,"So, what is the plan?"
5341,I've a feeling “hide here<hex:02100103>until help arrives” is out<hex:02100103>of the question.
5342,"As of the moment, that's<hex:02100103>about all I had..."
5343,Twelve save us...
5344,Looks as if we're<hex:02100103>out of boulders.
5345,That we are... HELP!!!

5361,There is much we can<hex:02100103>learn from today's defeat.
5362,It will be moons before these<hex:02100103>men and women are ready.
5363,By the Fury's spear...
5364,Carry the wounded<hex:02100103>to the barbers' tents!

5394,Then Mimiroon shall meet<hex:02100103>the meat we beat to eat!
5395,
5396,Mimiroon is saddened with<hex:02100103>much sadness! Sad!
5397,Ulp!
5398,Father!!!
5399,You lot look like you've<hex:02100103>been to the seventh hell and<hex:02100103>back. Report!
5400,We discovered what we<hex:02100103>thought were the remains<hex:02100103>of imperial warmachina.
5401,
5402,<hex:021A020203>Were<hex:021A020103> the remains?
5403,It came to life and started<hex:02100103>tracking us. We cannot<hex:02100103>return to Ala Ghiri without<hex:02100103>putting the camp in danger!
5404,Then that leaves us<hex:02100103>but one option.
5405,We destroy it...
5406,
5407,Or die trying.
5408,That's technically<hex:02100103>two options...
5409,We're running out of time!

5472,Or who does not dream of<hex:02100103>testing his mettle against<hex:02100103><hex:02080DE905FF04>her<hex:FF04>him<hex:03>.
5473,Are you suggesting what I<hex:02100103>think you're suggesting?
5474,Ahem!

5478,"Lost my appetite, I have..."
5479,Oh most glorious of<hex:02100103>glorious days!
5480,Freedom! Freedom!
5481,These jars won't<hex:02100103>fill themselves.
5482,Hm? Is anyone there?
5483,Najaq! Help!
5484,Hide! I shall deal with these.
5485,It cannot end here...<hex:02100103>I must protect my charge...
5486,
5487,What do you think's<hex:02100103>wrong with the fry?
5488,Hnnnh...
5489,Ahhh...
5490,"Begone, foul beasts!"
5491,Woof?
5492,J'najaq Sunflare will not<hex:02100103>leave this realm a coward!
5493,The Hingan's back!
5494,Still looking to<hex:02100103>“test your medals?”
5495,"Aye, young one. Would that<hex:02100103>there were a single brave<hex:02100103>soul on this whole isle..."
5496,You could always look for<hex:02100103>shells with me.
5497,"I could, but shells will not<hex:02100103>see me the greatest<hex:02100103>bladesman in Hingashi."
5498,I am Senban Oneblade.<hex:02100103>You will find honor in<hex:02100103>defeat at mine hands!
5499,THERE!<hex:02100103>THE GAP AT HIS FLANK!

5505,Hyah!
5506,Nnngaaah!
5507,I yield! I yield!
5508,"Well done, ijin.<hex:02100103>I daresay you fight with<hex:02100103>the heart of a Hingan."
5509,Hmph. Perhaps the rumors I<hex:02100103>heard of Eorzean mettle<hex:02100103>were exaggerated.
5510,That <hex:021A020203>was<hex:021A020103> more fun than<hex:02100103>collecting shells!
5511,Where is he!?<hex:02100103>Where is Senban Oneblade!?
5512,I've come for his blade.
5513,And I shall not<hex:02100103>leave without it!
5514,"Who in the seven hells<hex:02100103>are you, Redback?"
5515,"Out the mouth of babes, eh?"
5516,Get away!
5517,What manner of craven dares<hex:02100103>threaten a mere child!?
5518,"And here he is, friends!"
5519,"An honorable man would<hex:02100103>allow you to tend to your<hex:02100103>wounds, but I am no man, and<hex:02100103>I care little for honor. Attack!"
5520,The Hingan is still bleeding...
5521,You must help him!
5522,Hmph!
5523,Hyah!
5524,My thanks. You have shown<hex:02100103>me honor is no stranger<hex:02100103>to your people.
5525,I shall remember this always.<hex:02100103>Farewell. The mountains of<hex:02100103>my homeland await.
5526,I made no such promise!<hex:02100103>But...I may have some time<hex:02100103>before my ship sails.
5527,Hey! You said we'd look<hex:02100103>for shells when you finished!
5528,"I will return, Oneblade!<hex:02100103>I. Will. Return!"
5529,Victory is mine!<hex:02100103>Inform the bards that Senban<hex:02100103>is now the <hex:021A020203>None<hex:021A020103>blade!
5530,Wake up! Wake uuup!!!
5531,"Once again, you have<hex:02100103>my thanks for seeing<hex:02100103>my sister safe."
5532,"You are well versed in<hex:02100103>the art of war, it appears."
5533,"As it happens, my tribe<hex:02100103>seeks a warrior of your<hex:02100103>prowess to rid the land<hex:02100103>of a terrible blight."
5534,"Its name is Humbaba, and<hex:02100103>even the mighty J'moldva<hex:02100103>could not stand against it."
5535,"If you are willing, I shall lead<hex:02100103>you to its lair...and to glory<hex:02100103>everlasting!"
5536,Today the blight shall end!<hex:02100103>Today my sisters will be free!
5537,The tribe will ever sing of<hex:02100103>your deeds Your name will<hex:02100103>echo in our hearts.
5538,Come! There is no dishonor<hex:02100103>in fleeing to fight again<hex:02100103>another day.
5539,Hyah!
5540,"Time for a song, I reckon!"
5541,STAB HIM IN THE<hex:02100103>SOFT OF THE BELLY!
5542,Parry! Dodge! Spin!
5543,Heheh. You're not such a<hex:02100103>tough guy after all.
5544,An impressive display!
5545,"I have done you a great<hex:02100103>dishonor in underestimating<hex:02100103>your ability, stranger. I shall<hex:02100103>do so no longer!"
5546,TAKE HIS HEAD OFF!
5547,Perhaps that mouth needs a<hex:02100103>proper washing...with blood!
5548,I have failed my tribe...
5549,"First koja, now<hex:02100103>my own brothers!?"
5550,That'll hurt come sunrise...
5551,Enough! Enough! I'm dead!
5552,It yields no ground!
5553,With me!
5554,You will rue the day that<hex:02100103>you raised your blade to<hex:02100103>an innocent maid.
5555,"I've slain bigger creatures<hex:02100103>than you, but none as foul!"
5556,Why...? Why...?
5557,Why does this always...always...<hex:02100103>always always always<hex:02100103>ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME!!!?
5558,YOU WANT SOME FISH!?<hex:02100103>I'LL GIVE YOU SOME FISH!

5566,Heh heh! The plunder's<hex:02100103>right as rain!
5567,Good! Then you can give<hex:02100103>back to me and we'll all<hex:02100103>stay friends!
5568,Godsdammit! How did you─
5569,Find you? It was your stink.<hex:02100103>It carries across the entire<hex:02100103>Ruby Sea.

5660,<hex:021A020203>That<hex:021A020103> was for Lucy!
5661,Something's emerged from<hex:02100103>Bardam's Mettle...and it looks<hex:02100103>hungry!
5662,There's no time to move the<hex:02100103>herd. We'll need to slow the<hex:02100103>beast somehow!
5663,"If you haven't the will to<hex:02100103>fight, you'd best run now!"
5664,Hnyah!

5666,Ah! And now it's<hex:02100103>heading for the pens!
5667,"You've saved us, traveler.<hex:02100103>May the sun bless you."
5668,How dare they...attack...<hex:02100103>one of theirs... <pant> <pant>
5669,"You can't run forever, Gaei!"
5670,Your head is ours!
5671,Very well then. If I must spill<hex:02100103>the blood of mine own kin...
5672,Then spill it I shall!
5673,"We can be civil<hex:02100103>about this, Gaei!"
5674,"Just give us back the<hex:02100103>coin we stole...plus, say,<hex:02100103>another sack and we'll<hex:02100103>call things even!"
5675,He's here. I smell him!
5676,Keep your eyes peeled.<hex:02100103>They may come at any moment.
5677,We will avenge Zakuro's dishonor.
5678,"Turned tail and ran like the dogs they are, I wager."

5696,After them!
5697,It appears you've run<hex:02100103>yourselves aground!
5698,I expect as much from a<hex:02100103>rum-soaked Confederate<hex:02100103>but I'd heard you Westerners<hex:02100103>were of a more clever stock.
5699,"Who ye calling rum-soaked?<hex:02100103>I haven't had a drop in six<hex:02100103>bells, no thanks to you!"

5715,Hah! And don't come back!
5716,Just wait! You will soon wish<hex:02100103>you had died here today!
5717,There are simply too many...
5718,Gaei! Are you alright!?
5719,What have you gotten<hex:02100103>yourself into this time!?
5720,"The thieves found me, and<hex:02100103>would have killed me, had it<hex:02100103>not been for this stranger."
5721,And they still might!
5722,I'd like to see them try!
5723,"So that's how it is, eh!?"
5724,I'll tear each and every one<hex:02100103>of you from crotch to chin!
5725,Attack!

5734,I will not quit until<hex:02100103>justice is had!
5735,Brothers! To arms!
5736,How ever will we<hex:02100103>survive the winter now...?
5737,I'd tear their shells off...<hex:02100103>...iffin' I had a leg to stand on.
5738,Beat 'em bloody!
5739,More Redbacks comin'<hex:02100103>o'er the ridge!
5740,Ye've got 'em!
5741,Through the breach!

5753,I'll cut you to pieces!
5754,The sounds of battle have<hex:02100103>faded. Have I come too late?
5755,That was the last of them.
5756,Take this!
5757,At least without my sword<hex:02100103>I'm lighter on my feet...
5758,<wince>
5759,Had I...but one more life...
5760,What is important<hex:02100103>is that you came.
5761,I thought you said<hex:02100103>that was the last of them!
5762,Our fallen brothers will<hex:02100103>bother us no longer.
5763,Then what is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
5764,A hired blade?
5765,When will they learn!?
5766,Let them think<hex:02100103>they have won...
5767,<hex:021A020203>He<hex:021A020103> will soon be here.
5768,"Yes, but when!?"
5769,Soon! He'll be here s─
5770,Look! Beyond the rise!
5771,I told you!
5772,Is this the one needs killing?
5773,Guard well the<hex:02100103>young master!

5782,"I've no quarrel with you,<hex:02100103>outlander. But interfere<hex:02100103>and I will take you down, too."
5783,Grah!
5784,Didn't feel a thing!
5785,Cat got your tongue!?
5786,Hmph!
5787,Now I'm mad!
5788,Alright! Alright!<hex:02100103>You win!
5789,I'll...return the coin.
5790,Just leave me be!
5791,You should stick<hex:02100103>to the gambling tents.
5792,You fared better in there!
5793,Gah hah hah hah hah!
5794,Are there none here who<hex:02100103>might serve to right a wrong?
5795,You have done the Blues a<hex:02100103>great service. May you be<hex:02100103>blessed.
5796,Our altars will remain empty...<hex:02100103>But not as empty as our hearts.
5797,.........
5798,I believe I saw one over<hex:02100103>near those rocks!
5799,I must return home soon<hex:02100103>to prepare the altars.
5800,.........
5801,.........
5802,!?
5803,......!
5804,
5805,!!!
5806,......!?
5807,!!!
5808,!?
5809,What have we here?
5810,......!?
5811,"Still nothing to say, eh?<hex:02100103>Let our fists do the<hex:02100103>talking then!"
5812,!!!
5813,Hrah!
5814,.........
5815,.........
5816,That supposed to<hex:02100103>be a thank you?
5817,Right. I'll take that as a yes.
5818,That'll learn me to<hex:02100103>help a damn mute.
5819,"Please, outlander..."
5820,Don't let that one die...
5821,Help me!
5822,Hurry! Before they come back!
5823,I don't want<hex:02100103>to be a Budugan!
5824,I wasn't born to fight!<hex:02100103>I was born to herd!
5825,They'll kill me for certain...
5826,You! Take your hands<hex:02100103>off our new brother or<hex:02100103>we'll cut them off!
5827,The boy is ours!
5828,You cannot have him!
5829,Curses!
5830,Where is that foul vixen!
5831,"Show yourself, woman!"
5832,Find her or it's your blood<hex:02100103>I use in the next ritual!
5833,"She's a fox, not an eagle!<hex:02100103>She could not have gone far!"
5834,"You know not what<hex:02100103>you do, stranger!"
5835,You side with death itself!
5836,Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
5837,You will not stand in our way!
5838,Mercy is for the weak!
5839,I must away...<hex:02100103>Tamamo Gozen awaits...
5840,Where did she go!?
5841,We must inform<hex:02100103>Master Tendo!
5842,What is...this place...?
5843,Who...am I...?
5844,The pain... It is unbearable...!
5845,Why can I not...remember...?
5846,No... Why must they do this!?
5847,This kindness will<hex:02100103>not be forgotten.
5848,"I must go now to my mistress.<hex:02100103>Farewell, kind traveler."
5849,Make it stop...
5850,I know not this place...
5851,The people... I must...<hex:02100103>protect...the people...
5852,The people...? What people...?
5853,What is this place? What binds me here?
5854,Aaah! It feels as if my head were about to burst!
5855,"What is it that ails you, milady? Perhaps my associates and I can offer you succor."
5856,So much dark... So much pain...
5857,Did you feel that!? It was <hex:021A020203>her<hex:021A020103>! She is in there!
5858,"Kyubi of the Nine Tails! If you will not come out willingly, the girl's life is forfeit. Do you want that!?"
5859,"You're coming with us, <hex:021A020203>girl<hex:021A020103>!"
5860,Keep your hands off me!
5861,Away! All of you. Only death awaits you here...
5862,"Your death, yes. And then your power will be ours!"
5863,Tie her up!
5864,The pain... Make it stop!
5865,Forget the ropes. We complete the ritual here!
5866,"Rise, my pet! It is time to feed!"
5867,Please... Run now... While I am still...myself...
5868,I cannot hold on much lon─AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
5869,<growl> Who!? Who dares defile the land with their impure magicks!?
5870,"Brothers, behold! Protectress of Doma, Kyubi of the Nine Tails!"
5871,Should we...?
5872,Hold! Hold!
5873,I was...a fool...
5874,And thus...shall die one...
5875,What...have I...
5876,There! My mistress!<hex:02100103>She is still here with us!
5877,We must find her<hex:02100103>before it is too late!
5878,She is beyond my power. I must summon <hex:021A020203>him<hex:021A020103>.
5879,"Run, wicked defilers! I have eyes <hex:021A020203>everywhere<hex:021A020103>!"
5880,Master Tendo!!!
5881,The wind here seems...somehow familiar.
5882,But my past... It remains veiled in shadow...
5883,Kyubi of the Nine Tails! For twenty and five long summers have you wandered the land─
5884,The wounds suffered in defense of your mortal charges deep as the abyss!
5885,"But today, that journey ends! By mine hand, I shall free you!"
5886,I shall free all of you!
5887,Son of man! You are nothing!
5888,No man may command me... No man but─
5889,GRAAAHHH!
5890,Mistress! No!
5891,The spell of binding... Hurry! We must kill her! Now!
5892,Gah! I...cannot...brea─ Ack!
5893,Be calmed!
5894,She is lost in her own mind!
5895,"We must lure her back,<hex:02100103>or she'll be lost forever!"
5896,"Mistress, please!"
5897,"She must be saved, or<hex:02100103>the land will be ever cursed!"
5898,FREE ME! FREE ME FROM THIS PAIN!
5899,She... She's gone...
5900,"Come, we mustn't<hex:02100103>abandon hope!"
5901,Mistress!
5902,Is she─!?
5903,No. Her heart. It still beats!
5904,Come then! We must<hex:02100103>see her back to health!
5905,"Move your feet. You are<hex:02100103>a Budugan now, boy!"
5906,<sigh>
5907,Nothing...
5908,"They must have gone to ground, but where..."
5909,Please be all right...
5910,There has to be a clue<hex:02100103>somewhere around here...
5911,Gah! It's just a scratch...
5912,You shall bow to ME!
5913,Another day another brawl.
5914,“Giant” my arse...<hex:02100103>That thing is enormous!
5915,Our spears will only anger it!
5916,A thousand thanks.
5917,Men! We have something special for you today!
5918,And some of you might just come out of it alive!
5919,Remember... KILL THEM ALL!
5920,Ready!?
5921,Hah!
5922,<grunt>
5923,Over here!
5924,I'm not finished with you yet!
5925,Argh!
5926,Hmph!
5927,Hyah!
5928,No you don't!
5929,Not this day! Not ever!
5930,Stay down!
5931,Azim! Why have<hex:02100103>you forsaken us!
5932,Is everyone alright?
5933,This wound will have to<hex:02100103>be cleaned and dressed...
5934,Father! Mother! Where are you!?
5935,Bayan...
5936,
5937,<trumpet>
5938,
5939,The wind is calm. The air clear.
5940,"Aye, the sun sends<hex:02100103>us his blessing."
5941,Where are we bound?
5942,North. Past the Dawn Throne<hex:02100103>and across Tao Khaal.
5943,I shall ride at the van.
5944,Anarba! That is not<hex:02100103>for you to decide! Anarba!
5945,
5946,
5947,Buzzflies!
5948,They've our scent.<hex:02100103>There'll be no outrunning<hex:02100103>them now. Blades out!
5949,Let us hope<hex:02100103>that is all of them.
5950,
5951,
5952,
5953,Our fortunes will turn...<hex:02100103>We must will them so.
5954,
5955,
5956,
5957,"Rise, my people!<hex:02100103>Our journey continues!"
5958,Khan! Gedan block our path!
5959,Protect the animals!
5960,See! Our path is blessed!
5961,
5962,
5963,
5964,It is here we shall make camp!
5965,Altani! See to the stallion!
5966,"Yes, Khan."
5967,This way. Quietly now.
5968,The losses do not<hex:02100103>seem too great... Still...
5969,
5970,
5971,
5972,We make our camp here.
5973,
5974,
5975,
5976,"Gather, little ones!<hex:02100103>It is time for milking!"
5977,Would the traveler<hex:02100103>like to join me?
5978,"Rarely do we collect enough<hex:02100103>to make cheese, but today..."
5979,So many jugs!<hex:02100103>This calls for celebration!
5980,Barely enough to boil a goat's<hex:02100103>head. But it will have to do.
5981,There! You can see the<hex:02100103>dust rise from the steppe!
5982,A herd of wild dzos!
5983,Even a few of their number<hex:02100103>will fill our tribe's bellies<hex:02100103>and see our tents warm.
5984,A bowl of hot khorkhog<hex:02100103>is reward enough for<hex:02100103>the day's hunt!
5985,"The khorkhog will be thin<hex:02100103>tonight, I'm afraid..."
5986,Something has the<hex:02100103>animals frightened.
5987,Listen! The howls of gedan!
5988,"Quick, Altani!<hex:02100103>See to the sheep!"
5989,It is the same pack that<hex:02100103>hounded us earlier. They<hex:02100103>will follow until they are<hex:02100103>sated...or dead.
5990,"Yes, mother!"
5991,More come from the north!
5992,Let them!
5993,They will disturb us no longer.
5994,"This way, little ones!"
5995,
5996,
5997,The pack has our scent.
5998,"Their noses are bloodied,<hex:02100103>but if we do not leave now,<hex:02100103>they will soon grow bold again."
5999,My people! We break camp!
6000,It is time.<hex:02100103>To the north and east!
6001,Halt! It is too quiet...<hex:02100103>Even the crickets do not sing...
6002,Drop your weapons and we'll<hex:02100103>let your women live...with us!
6003,Bandits!
6004,
6005,
6006,
6007,'Tis fortunate they were<hex:02100103>drunk. Alcohol will gift a man<hex:02100103>bravery...but always for a price.
6008,
6009,
6010,
6011,Run!
6012,Not without me you don't!
6013,We'll be taking these...<hex:02100103>and these...and also these.
6014,Hahaha! Tonight we dine<hex:02100103>as champions of the steppe!
6015,The steppe is no<hex:02100103>place for the weak!
6016,"The bandits will tell others<hex:02100103>of this battle, and they will<hex:02100103>be drawn to the promise of<hex:02100103>blood and plunder. We move!"
6017,Sounds of fighting!
6018,There! A lone warrior...and<hex:02100103>a mammoth!
6019,She will not survive.
6020,Then she will not survive.<hex:02100103>That is the way of the steppe.
6021,No! We cannot just leave her!
6022,The steppe is full of enemies.<hex:02100103>This is why we must embrace<hex:02100103>newfound friends.
6023,There is little life left in her.
6024,She was a fool to<hex:02100103>walk the steppe alone.
6025,"That's no reason to leave<hex:02100103>her to die, Anarba!"
6026,Altani speaks true.
6027,We shall make camp here<hex:02100103>and decide as a tribe how<hex:02100103>we are to proceed.
6028,I will see to the<hex:02100103>stranger's wounds.
6029,"Altani, you look uneasy."
6030,The sheep... They won't eat.
6031,"Won't eat, you say?<hex:02100103>That <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> odd..."
6032,It might be they<hex:02100103>sense something amiss.
6033,You stay here while I see<hex:02100103>if I cannot discover the<hex:02100103>reason for their disquiet.
6034,"Yes, Khan! And...be careful."
6035,Altani was right.
6036,The sheep will calm now.
6037,
6038,That horse... It doesn't<hex:02100103>appear to be one of ours.
6039,"Where is your rider, boy?"
6040,You look hungry. Come with<hex:02100103>me. Altani will see you fed<hex:02100103>and watered.
6041,They're finally leaving...
6042,You're awake.
6043,I have you and your tribe<hex:02100103>to thank for that.
6044,That's not all.
6045,Bayan! You're... You're...!
6046,My apologies. I was just so─<hex:02100103>I am Gurbesu of the Goro.
6047,"This is my promised, Bayan."
6048,My tribe's food tents were<hex:02100103>destroyed in a Matanga raid.
6049,I went hunting to replenish<hex:02100103>our supplies and in my<hex:02100103>desperation─
6050,Attacked a mammoth.
6051,Attacked a mammoth.
6052,"If you had not intervened...<hex:02100103>My life, I owe to your<hex:02100103>people."
6053,What of the rest<hex:02100103>of your tribe?
6054,"I do not know. We lost many<hex:02100103>in the raid, and if the Matanga<hex:02100103>attacked again while I was<hex:02100103>hunting..."
6055,The steppe... It moves!
6056,Look! Over there!
6057,<trumpet>
6058,Au Ra!
6059,Blood to earth!<hex:02100103>Blood to earth!
6060,We are discovered!<hex:02100103>Spears out!
6061,Back! Back! Baaack!
6062,They're running away!
6063,They were no match<hex:02100103>for our courage.
6064,The Matanga...<hex:02100103>They were here for me.
6065,I cannot stay here.
6066,I am the cause<hex:02100103>of this destruction.
6067,"Nonsense! You shared our<hex:02100103>water, our fire. You stood<hex:02100103>at our side in battle."
6068,"What will you do now,<hex:02100103>Gurbesu of the Goro?"
6069,The only thing I can─search for my tribe.
6070,Then we will search with you.
6071,"You are one of us now, and<hex:02100103>we would not allow a sister<hex:02100103>to walk the steppe alone."
6072,I... I don't know what to say...
6073,Then say nothing.<hex:02100103>It is already decided.
6074,I've fed and watered Bayan.
6075,Thank you... Thank you all!
6076,"We ride, my people!<hex:02100103>But keep your weapons<hex:02100103>at the ready! All eyes ahead!"
6077,"Father sun, almighty..."
6078,The Matanga have returned...<hex:02100103>and this time in numbers.
6079,
6080,
6081,
6082,To caves! To caves!
6083,Something is wrong. That was<hex:02100103>too organized for a retreat...
6084,
6085,
6086,
6087,Then let us rest<hex:02100103>while we can.
6088,Gurbesu. You say that<hex:02100103>beyond lies the location<hex:02100103>of your tribe's last camp?
6089,"Yes, Khan. While I expect it<hex:02100103>to be abandoned, perhaps<hex:02100103>we will find some clue as<hex:02100103>to which direction they fled."
6090,We should be nearing it now.
6091,Wait... I see smoke...
6092,It appears your tribe did not<hex:02100103>leave...nor did the Matanga!
6093,
6094,Au Ra! Many and more!
6095,Blood to earth!<hex:02100103>Blood to earth!
6096,Back to caves!
6097,"Death come, Au Ra!<hex:02100103>Death come!"
6098,My brothers! My sisters!<hex:02100103>You are safe!
6099,As are you and Bayan.<hex:02100103>This is good.
6100,But you do not come alone.
6101,"Tell me, Gurbesu..."
6102,Why would the Dataq lift<hex:02100103>their spears for the Goro?
6103,"We would lift them for<hex:02100103>Gurbesu, so we would<hex:02100103>lift them for you."
6104,Khan...
6105,<trumpet>
6106,Kill all! Kill all!
6107,Death to Au Ra!<hex:02100103>Death to trunkless!
6108,Blood to earth!<hex:02100103>Blood to earth!
6109,0
6110,There is no Dataq and no<hex:02100103>Goro. Only sisters and<hex:02100103>brothers of the steppe!
6111,Kiiiiiiiiilll!
6112,
6113,
6114,King come! Au Ra kill!
6115,Anjana come!<hex:02100103>Give blood to earth!
6116,Why do they not attack?
6117,<hex:021A020203>That<hex:021A020103> is why!
6118,WHERE ARE MY CHILDREN!?
6119,
6120,Together! Stand together!
6121,
6122,
6123,CEASE THIS CLAMOR!
6124,ENOUGH!
6125,
6126,
6127,
6128,Anjana dead! Matanga lost!
6129,Away! Away!
6130,They break! Now the<hex:02100103>slaughter begins!
6131,
6132,Anarba! Is it not enough<hex:02100103>that the day is ours?
6133,"Khan is right, Anarba. No<hex:02100103>more blood need be spilled<hex:02100103>this day."
6134,Let us see to the wounded<hex:02100103>then leave this cursed place.
6135,"Brothers and sisters of the<hex:02100103>Dataq, we are forever in<hex:02100103>your debt."
6136,The song of your tribe's<hex:02100103>bravery will be sung at<hex:02100103>our fires for generations<hex:02100103>to come.
6137,"As they will at ours,<hex:02100103>brave Goro. Until we<hex:02100103>meet again."
6138,Dataq! To your mounts.<hex:02100103>We ride!
6139,"Farewell, Gurbesu. Bayan."
6140,Farewell!
6141,"The more mercy you show, the less you'll receive from me!<hex:02100103>Now, BEGIN!"
6142,"It ends here, Adri!"
6143,"Guerrilla tactics, shield<hex:02100103>walls─neither'll save my<hex:02100103>men from the cannons of<hex:02100103>an imperial reaper."
6144,No... What they need is<hex:02100103>something unpredictable.<hex:02100103>Something volatile...
6145,
6146,
6147,There is only one rule on<hex:02100103>the front lines: don't break.<hex:02100103>Break and you're dea─
6148,You there! Are you listening!?
6149,One! Two! Three!
6150,Again!
6151,A parry that slow<hex:02100103>will be your last!
6152,Faster! Faster!
6153,
6154,
6155,<doze>
6156,"S-Sir! Dead, sir! Yes, sir!"
6157,One!
6158,Two!
6159,Three!
6160,How long do we have to wait?
6161,"They promise us a mock<hex:02100103>battle, but give us lectures."
6162,"Kissed by the Fury, indeed!"
6163,Such strength! Such speed!
6164,Hahaha! I haven't been so<hex:02100103>frightened for my life since<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>I<hex:021A020103> was a recruit!
6165,Do you think they've<hex:02100103>had enough?
6166,Enough? When I was their<hex:02100103>age I broke my fast on<hex:02100103>heroes of the realm!
6167,.........
6168,"Alright, maybe<hex:02100103>they've had enough."
6169,But that doesn't mean I'm<hex:02100103>letting them off easy!
6170,Twelve help us all...
6171,We're not finished yet!
6172,You cannot defeat us all!
6173,Your time has come!
6174,Fools! Beaten by your<hex:02100103>own meaten!
6175,That is why always you<hex:02100103>are hungering!
6176,Bow down before me!
6177,Leave this one to me!
6178,Please... Just one more word.
6179,I'm saved! (I hope!)
6180,It is as I said!
6181,The Buduga!
6182,
6183,
6184,How did they<hex:02100103>get behind us!?
6185,The village is<hex:02100103>not much further!
6186,
6187,"Thank you, traveler. My<hex:02100103>tribe will see me safe now."
6188,I am a Mol!
6189,Leave me alone!
6190,
6191,
6192,
6193,"There is nowhere to run, boy!"
6194,Your tribe will not have<hex:02100103>you back now!
6195,We are your tribe now!
6196,One of us! One of us!
6197,
6198,
6199,
6200,You ahem-ed?
6201,Were you going to call<hex:02100103>in reinforcements?
6202,I hadn't planned on it.
6203,Perhaps you should?
6204,Perhaps.
6205,Go! Gather weapons now!
6206,
6207,To Ala Gannha!
6208,To town of meat!
6209,Father! Father!
6210,"<sigh> Another night in<hex:02100103>the stables, I reckon."
6211,Neutralize the enemy's capacity to heal its wounded.<hex:02100103>Standard battle tactics.
6212,And then there were two!
6213,And then there was one─one with the strength of ten!
6214,I wasn't in best form today...
6215,Well this is embarrassing...
6216,You needn't have pulled your punches...but this act of <hex:021A020203>clemence<hex:021A020103> is certain to cheer the men's spirits. <wink>
6217,Not all our men are as green<hex:02100103>as the recruits!
6218,"If <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> underestimated us,<hex:02100103>perhaps the Empire will, too!"
6219,Gah hah hah hah hah!
6220,Stay your blades! We yield!
6221,Much was to be had from the day's exercises.
6222,May they see us─may they see <hex:021A020203>Eorzea<hex:021A020103> to victory!
6223,My instruments are picking something up!
6224,Blades down! That is enough!
6225,It was an honor to exchange<hex:02100103>blows with you this day.
6226,"Of course, emerging victorious<hex:02100103>didn't hurt, either. Gah hah hah!"
6227,Time to check the nets<hex:02100103>I laid last night.
6228,Flying sharks!? This far<hex:02100103>from the Tide!?
6229,My nets torn and my catch<hex:02100103>devoured! What am I to do!?
6230,Damnable sharks!
6231,Now I'll have to find a new<hex:02100103>place farther up river!
6232,The waters no longer boil.<hex:02100103>The sharks have returned<hex:02100103>to the Tide.
6233,Now to see if there is aught<hex:02100103>remaining of my ne─
6234,Hells take me! It's a...a...<hex:02100103>giant <hex:021A020203>weasel<hex:021A020103>!
6235,What have I done<hex:02100103>to deserve this!?
6236,Is it...dead?
6237,It is! The weasel is dead!
6238,Wait... Flying sharks and giant<hex:02100103>weasels? My wife is never<hex:02100103>going to believe me!
6239,I need to catch some fish...now!
6240,How am I going to explain<hex:02100103>this to my wife? I'm doomed...
6241,Traveler! Over here!<hex:02100103>OVER HERE!
6242,What are we going to do?<hex:02100103>What are we going to do!?
6243,Is this enough? I suppose it's<hex:02100103>enough... But what if it's not<hex:02100103>enough? What if old nan dies<hex:02100103>because we didn't have that<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>one last seedling<hex:021A020103>!
6244,Thank the stars<hex:02100103>we will not starve!
6245,We're doomed... The Empire<hex:02100103>will take what little we have<hex:02100103>and leave us to starve!
6246,Heh heh heh!
6247,Catch me if you can!
6248,
6249,
6250,Four here... Six there...<hex:02100103>They're everywhere!
6251,If all these eggs<hex:02100103>were to hatch...
6252,"You have already brought<hex:02100103>me so many, I couldn't think<hex:02100103>of asking you to bring more...<hex:02100103>unless you wanted to, that is."
6253,The village thanks you...<hex:02100103>as does my belly!
6254,I must warn<hex:02100103>the other villagers...
6255,It can't be...!<hex:02100103>It was just a story!
6256,This is the place<hex:02100103>the villagers spoke of.
6257,From here emerges the evil<hex:02100103>spirit that haunts their fields.
6258,It is here I will find my quarry!
6259,"Shall I wait,<hex:02100103>or shall I attack?"
6260,Can you feel it?<hex:02100103>The creature approaches!
6261,There! With me!
6262,There are others!?
6263,What foul plot requires<hex:02100103>this many servants!?
6264,I will not be<hex:02100103>defeated so easily!
6265,Come! I do not fear death!
6266,I may have<hex:02100103>failed the village...
6267,But this land has not seen<hex:02100103>the last of Senban Oneblade!
6268,Victory is ours!
6269,The onmyoji's henchmen will<hex:02100103>trouble the villagers no longer.
6270,Yet I fear his work<hex:02100103>is far from complete.
6271,"He plots something most<hex:02100103>treacherous, and I will not<hex:02100103>rest until he has been silenced!"
6272,"A plump pack you have<hex:02100103>there traveler! Oh, so plump!"
6273,"A right plump pack, yes!"
6274,Open that pack!
6275,
6276,Pack! Pack! Pack!
6277,More blood!
6278,Ooooooooow!
6279,I'll make this quick!
6280,Tigers! And they look hungry!
6281,I...think my bath can wait!
6282,Where is everyone going?
6283,T-T-T-T-T-TIGERS!!!
6284,Don't eat me! I'm fugu!<hex:02100103>Aaaaaack!
6285,Farewell...cruel world...
6286,Poke it again!
6287,Poke poke poke poke!
6288,Now you poke it!
6289,Poke it harder! Harder!
6290,Gouge <hex:02080DE905FF04>her<hex:FF04>his<hex:03> eyes!<hex:02100103>Cut out <hex:02080DE905FF04>her<hex:FF04>his<hex:03> tongue!
6291,None who bear witness<hex:02100103>shall be suffered to live!
6292,
6293,"You have not seen<hex:02100103>the last of us, meddler!"
6294,What funny hats...<hex:02100103>Maybe they'll let me have one.
6295,Aaah! Aaah! Aaaaaahhh!
6296,You can keep your hats!
6297,"Gaei out battling<hex:02100103>injustice again, eh?"
6298,Looks as if both<hex:02100103>sides are Lupin.
6299,You know how Gaei gets<hex:02100103>about trading blows with<hex:02100103>his brothers.
6300,"You're free to do what you<hex:02100103>please, my friend. I'll stay here."
6301,"When will you learn, Gaei?"
6302,Your pack is weak!
6303,Argh! That smarts...! What are these... Arrows?
6304,The archer! Kill him first!
6305,Uh... We can still discuss<hex:02100103>this like civil wolves!
6306,A Kojin? Here in Yanxia?
6307,We've enough to worry about<hex:02100103>here without those shellbacks.
6308,"Let this one live, and another<hex:02100103>hundred will be on the shores<hex:02100103>by new moon."
6309,Then let's see him dead!
6310,Move!
6311,Did he just─?
6312,Ruuuuuun!
6313,Victory is sweetest when<hex:02100103>won with a straight heart!
6314,Ooooooooow!
6315,<sigh> Let's see now...
6316,"125,001... 125,002..."
6317,"...250,000. That should suffice."
6318,None can withstand the<hex:02100103>might of Yojimbo! Hahahah!
6319,"Yes, bring me their heads!"
6320,Let us see...
6321,This time you're finished! Hahahah!
6322,All's well!
6323,Gah!
6324,Oho...
6325,Hm hmmm...
6326,"Good, precise movements."
6327,You have a feel for the blade.
6328,Hah!
6329,They won't make<hex:02100103>me one of them!
6330,I want to go home!
6331,For...ever...
6332,And...ever...
6333,"Farewell, Mother... Father..."
6334,Woooaaagh!
6335,Yaaargh!
6336,Eat this!
6337,Die!
6338,"We came for the treasure! Yes, yes! Where is it?"
6339,It is mine! Everything here─it is all mine!
6340,To go left or to go right? That is the question...
6341,Show no mercy to any who stand in our way!
6342,Retreat! Retreat!
6343,"You want to fight? Yes, yes! Well, it is a fight you will get!"
6344,I will cut you down!
6345,Graaah!
6346,Aaargh! <hex:02080CE905FF04>She<hex:FF03>He<hex:03> got me─right in the gut!
6347,The best fighters know when to stay and when to flee! Ghahaha! You shan't catch me!
6348,It was all true!
6349,I'm never leaving<hex:02100103>my bed again!
6350,Was it truly Tsurubebi...<hex:02100103>or something else...?
6351,No. Don't tell me.<hex:02100103>I don't want to know.
6352,I'm never leaving<hex:02100103>my bed again!
6353,They've surrounded us...
6354,There must be some way...
6355,Right then. Follow my lead.
6356,Those are mine!<hex:02100103>Mine! Mine! Mine!
6357,Hit him in the head! The head!
6358,Those are mine!<hex:02100103>Mine! Mine! Mine!
6359,Right to the whiskers!<hex:02100103>The whiskers!
6360,GRAYHYGRAGRRRYAH!
6361,Pick the pack! Pick the pack!
6362,Keep your plump pack!<hex:02100103>Keep it! Keep it!
6363,You will always be weak!
6364,<whimper> <whimper>
6365,"Might I suggest a strategic,<hex:02100103>yet not at all shameful retreat?"
6366,They'll think twice before<hex:02100103>coming back...won't they?
6367,Kindest of kindly strangers!<hex:02100103>Mimiroon is most grateful<hex:02100103>for such kind kindness!
6368,"You will protect me, then?<hex:02100103>Twelve be praised!"
6369,Aaah! We're discovered!
6370,Rats as those deserve<hex:02100103>no mercy! Not a damn whit!
6371,Please...<cough> <hack> <hex:02100103><wheeze> Hurry...! <choke>

6392,Look out!
6393,My legs are about to give out.
6394,Hurry up and win!
6395,Help me! I'm dying!
6396,Time to go!
6397,No give up!
6398,Hurry!
6399,Slow down!
6400,No no no!
6401,"Oh, so scary..."
6402,Slay bad ones!
6403,Help!
6404,"After you, then!"
6405,Then you are with us!
6406,May Rhalgr grant us strength!
6407,Then you are with us!
6408,May Rhalgr grant us strength!
6409,Shall we get going?
6410,Maybe I should have brought my sword...
6411,Do you need to rest?
6412,"Wait, not so fast!"
6413,"<hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>, your help!"
6414,If only I were stronger...
6415,Another beast blocks our path.
6416,I cannot carry on much longer...
6417,What an amazing place!
6418,So this is the Isle of Endless Summer. Beautiful.
6419,"Today, we swim!"
6420,Wait for me!
6421,"Oh me, oh my, look at all these lovely little things out today. And they're all just my type."
6422,What was that? I could have sworn I heard something.
6423,You're imagining things.
6424,"Hey, ladies! Care to come have a romp with me?"
6425,Eeeeeek!
6426,"Don't be shy, now. There's no use running away!"
6427,A talking octopus!? Is this some new voidsent!?
6428,"Ugh, all those muscles. You're not my type!"
6429,"I may be just an octopus, but I'll not lose to the likes of you!"
6430,"This is not looking good... Oh no, I forgot to call Master Typhon."
6431,Master Typhon! Heeelp meee!
6432,Hyah!
6433,You'll not ruin our faire!
6434,Argh!
6435,"Ow, ow, ow! Enough, enough!"
6436,"I yield, I yield! I just wanted...to enjoy the faire...like everyone else."
6437,I find that hard to believe.
6438,I promise I'll be good. I swear!
6439,"Do you? Step out of line again, and you won't get off so easy."
6440,"Gwee-hee-hee. I promise, I promise. An octopus always keeps his word."
6441,Gwee-hee-hee! Such pretty little things!
6442,Mwa ha ha! Just my type!
6443,"Farewell, farewell!"
6444,I can't be bothered with this anymore!
6445,Gwee-hee-hee! Where are all the laaadies!?
6446,The big ones are biting! Need any bait?
6447,Could you stand to part with one of those?
6448,"That'll be 1,000,000 gil!"
6449,You're out of your mind!
6450,You blaming me? Huh!?
6451,I'll take my business elsewhere.
6452,"Trying to make off without paying? Get back here, you bastard!"
6453,You looking to get yourself hurt?
6454,S-Stop it!
6455,You two! What's going on!?
6456,"Bah, damned faire chaperones. Come on!"
6457,I'm leaving this fight to you!
6458,Run awaaay!
6459,Hyah!
6460,Take that!
6461,Go back to your damn faire!
6462,Arrrgh!
6463,Stop this at once!
6464,Stand down!
6465,These bastards are strong... Retreat! Retreat!
6466,"Serves you right for not minding your business. Come on, after that fisherman!"
6467,And don't come back!
6468,Ugh... It's no use. We have to fall back.
6469,All that's left is to deliver these fish.
6470,Snippers! Why did it have to be snippers!?
6471,Shoo! Shoo!
6472,Keep it up!
6473,"Thanks. You saved me, and my fish."
6474,No! My fish... My beautiful fish...
6475,Gods be good... Look at all this rubbish!
6476,Thank you! You've made the beach beautiful again!
6477,It's no good. There's still too much rubbish. We may need more hands.
6478,Bring me your rubbish! Every last bit you can find!
6479,Gather your rubbish! I'll collect it!
6480,Thanks for the help. I think our work here is done.
6481,"If you still have rubbish, I'll take it off your hands!"
6482,A <hex:020817E4E80202FF0A>promising<hex:FF06>plain<hex:03> <hex:02280EFF09>Treasure<hex:E8040103> is discovered upon defeating <hex:023110FF09>BNpcName<hex:03E803020203>!

7048,Another time!
7049,'Twas a pleasure!
7050,Well done!
7051,"Still there, huh?"
7052,We take our leave!
7053,Ohoho... We come!
7054,Mud to stone!
7055,Boom boom goes me!
7056,Boom boom!
7057,Boom?
7058,To boom or not to boom?
7059,"Rolling, rolling, rolling..."
7060,Spinny spinny!
7061,Welcome to die!
7062,They see me rolling...
7063,They hating...
7064,Welcome back to die!
7065,Bye-bye!
7066,So long!
7067,You die now!
7068,Roll out!
7069,You ready?
7070,Run to die!
7071,I am rock!
7072,I am also rock!
7073,I still rock!
7074,I still also rock!
7075,We rock you!
7076,We rock you!
7077,Rock you like typhoon!
7078,Rock you like typhoon!
7079,Can't stop!
7080,Won't stop!
7081,Achy break!
7082,Breaky ache!
7083,You good...
7084,Real good...
7085,You still good...
7086,Still real good...
7087,You underestimate me!
7088,"My thanks, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>."
7089,"You seem troubled, friends. Not getting tired, are you?"
7090,By the Fury! What is that?
7091,It comes!
7092,Fear not! Help is on the way!
7093,Quickly! To me!
7094,"This is for you, old friend."
7095,"This one's for you, Papalymo."
7096,Behold the art of the shinobi!
7097,"Go on, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>. Leave these soldiers to us."
7098,Sellgob whack-ready! Whack and thwack for uplander!
7099,"For jinglyshine, gobbies frontcharge! Gobbies smashstrike!"
7100,It looks ready to explode. Stand back!
7101,An explosive!? It must be stopped.
7102,It's going to blow!
7103,
7104,
7105,"Such sweet blood, so very fresh. But...oh! Yours is fresher still..."
7106,I shall sup gently on your veins. So very gently...
7107,Now see what you've done! Mine own blood is spilled! Mine...mine...MINE... 
7108,Friends! Partners! Come closer... See my wares! I bring only the finest.
7109,Friends! Partners! A humble invitation─learn how this blade cuts!
7110,"Now, my partners! What do you offer in trade? One life, or more?"
7111,Miserly mortals! I ask for so little─only your lifeblood!
7112,<hiss>
7113,<growl>
7114,"The aether here feels...corrupted, kupo..."
7115,"We probably shouldn't go barging in there alone, kupo!"
7116,This all feels familiar...like back in Ridorana...
7117,"I imagine this is what it is like to be swallowed by a morbol, kupo!"
7118,"There are traces of aetherial residue here. Most likely from auracite, kupo."
7119,"The aether here is different. Is this...joy I feel, kupo?"
7120,"This wine looks good enough to drink! Do you think we should─? No? Alright, kupo..."
7121,"There is much pain in the aether here. A great loss, kupo..."
7122,"Let me guess, someone from the Durai Papers, kupo?"
7123,"I'm going to go out on a limb and guess this place is fairly old, kupo."
7124,"Might you recall earlier when I said the aether felt corrupted? Well, it's <hex:021A020203>really<hex:021A020103> corrupted now, kupo!"
7125,"Mullonde? Now where have I heard that name before, kupo?"
7126,"Wait... What is Cid doing down here, kupo?"
7127,"Something is wrong... I sense both anguish and rapture, kupo!"
7128,"You mustn't fear her! Leave that to me, kupo!"

7173,Ready!?
7174,I shan't hold back!

7188,Fuuunfuuun!!!

7191,"Die, frozen in fear!"
7192,You cannot escape the inevitable!
7193,Is that all you've got!?
7194,Your corpse will feed my flames!
7195,"You fight bravely, but your time has come!"
7196,This is as far as you go!
7197,The sky weeps burning tears to lament your passing!
7198,We've only just begun!
7199,Now fall!
7200,Oh no you don't!
7201,Feel the might of Tizona!
7202,Fury give me strength!
7203,We must hold the line!

7238,This wasn't the deal!
7239,Not like this...

7255,"Ryne, the cartridges!"
7256,That this should all be an illusion...
7257,"Watering the plants? Nay, strengthening them."
7258,What magick is this that could create such a convincing illusion?
7259,"Another landscape... How much further to the crown, I wonder."
7260,A wasp nest! Have care!
7261,Never have I seen such mastery over glamours.
7262,A Fuath! And it's...watering the plants?
7263,Such breathtaking scenery...
7264,More illusions? You have to hand it to them...
7265,A wasp nest? Really?
7266,"Real or no, it's beautiful beyond words..."
7267,The crown already? Forgive me if I'm suspicious.
7268,So this is the realm of the water spirits...
7269,Seems they don't mean to make this easy for us.
7270,"Ah, yes, the good old stop-them-with-wasps trick."
7271,Naught here is what it seemeth. Tread warily.
7272,'Twould seem our trials do continue.
7273,The crown... With its protectors conspicuous in their absence...
7274,"Oh, my! Did you see the flowers?"
7275,A palace of water... It's like something out of a faerie tale...
7276,The crown! We've found it!
7277,It's like being in a dream...
7278,Yet the dangers of this dream are very real. Be not distracted by its beauty.
7279,Is that a Fuath? What is it doing?
7280,"Making their minions stronger, by the looks of it."
7281,"Stay focused, Minfilia."
7282,Look! The landscape is changing!
7283,It seems they haven't quite had enough games.
7284,A wasp nest? Really?
7285,They certainly have no shortage of ideas.
7286,Except we're the ones in the tale. Stay on your guard.
7287,"No, stop! I smell a trap!"
7288,"If it stands in our way, it falls like the rest."
7289,No. It was just toying with us.
7290,"They recreated a legend, is that it?"
7291,Imitation will only take you so far.
7292,This time we'll really have the crown!
7293,"Focus on the fight, Minfilia─not the prize."
7294,It seems the statues aren't only for show.
7295,The statues stir.
7296,Have care. I sense aether emanating from the statues...
7297,Right!
7298,Surely they wouldn't try the same trick twice?
7299,Another array of statues. No doubt these too serve to guard our path.
7300,"More statues. Another trap, I should think."
7301,More statues!
7302,"Their leader, if I'm not mistaken. Ware its glamours."
7303,"Aye, but I doubt they would lay the same trap twice."
7304,No beating about the bush with this one.
7305,There's no getting around this one...
7306,Its design calls to mind the Ronkan legends of giants. Fascinating...
7307,The Ronkans guard their secrets well.
7308,Finally. The way forward is open.
7309,We... We did it!
7310,Though thankfully nowhere near the fabled might of Lozatl.
7311,Truly a fascinating specimen of Ronkan ingenuity.
7312,An earthquake? Nay. Something stirreth deep within...
7313,What's that?
7314,I care not to see the source of these tremors.
7315,Keep your guard up.
7316,Do you hear that?
7317,On thy guard. Carelessness shall find no clemency here.
7318,There it is again!
7319,Stay on your guard. We near the tremors' source.
7320,"If you desire sport, we're happy to oblige!"
7321,"Lovely, a leaf monster."
7322,"That's a nice illusion, but you can't fool us!"
7323,So <hex:021A020203>you're<hex:021A020103> the one making all that racket?
7324,"The source of the ghastly wails and tremors both, 'twould seem."
7325,That such a beast could survive down here all this time...
7326,By the gods! It's hideous!
7327,Any longer and I thought this cave might've collapsed.
7328,"Whence did the bat enter here, I wonder."
7329,I fear my ears will be ringing for quite some time.
7330,My ears won't stop ringing...
7331,"Would that we could stop and rest, but we must press on."
7332,Fresh air. Thank the gods.
7333,It's beautiful...
7334,At last. Rak'tika Falls...
7335,And below awaiteth the Lightwarden.
7336,Sin eaters... Then our suspicions were correct. 
7337,Sin eaters!
7338,Sin eaters. We're getting close.
7339,Let's cut this overgrown scrub down to size.
7340,"Ah, the final form. Or should I say <hex:021A020203>false<hex:021A020103> form?"
7341,"The sooner we get this over with, the better."
7342,"A rather nasty-looking thing, isn't it?"
7343,That's the Lightwarden!?
7344,The Lightwarden of Rak'tika...
7345,'Tis more terrible than the Viis described.
7346,Let's get moving.
7347,I can sense the Warden somewhere below us.
7348,The ancients were well beyond their time.
7349,"Can you sense the Warden, Ryne?"
7350,"Yes, but I think it's further underground."
7351,This tunnel seems to stretch on forever...
7352,It looks like we can descend from here.
7353,What do you suppose we'll find down here?
7354,We have to go deeper...
7355,Isn't that a little big for an armadillo?
7356,That their chieftain should personally stand in our way...
7357,"Curious... Yonder creature doth resemble Griaule, a beast of Voeburtite legend."
7358,'Twould seem we are come to the grand finale.
7359,Shall we get this over and done with?
7360,"I would rather not slay the beast, but if it means to bar our way..."
7361,Is that a...giant armadillo!?
7362,It's in the way is what it is.
7363,If I never see an armadillo again...
7364,"Phew, glad that's over with."
7365,Let us press onward. The Warden awaits.
7366,Thankfully no one was hurt.
7367,A shame the miners haven't the means to keep building.
7368,We need to climb down somehow.
7369,We've reached the pit.
7370,Well there has to be a path somewhere...
7371,Hopefully this tunnel continues downward.
7372,With any luck this tunnel will lead down.
7373,Come. We mustn't tarry.
7374,And into the heart of the Warden's lair.
7375,Are those...buckets...?
7376,Is this some sort of joke?
7377,This certainly isn't what I was expecting.
7378,"Why, yes... Yes I believe they are..."
7379,I think I now understand Alphinaud's aversion to water.
7380,I never knew buckets could be so dangerous.
7381,"Gods, I'm soaked to the bone."
7382,Not. Another. Word...
7383,These crystals are devoid of aether...
7384,Looks like we're getting closer.
7385,Terrible is the beast that doth wreak such corruption.
7386,0
7387,We're nearly there. I can feel it!
7388,I have a bad feeling about these boulders...
7389,"Oh gods, the boulders. They're filling with light!"
7390,Careful. I sense something queer within these rocks.
7391,"Gods, is nothing safe from the sin eaters' corruption?"
7392,"This is for you, Tesleen."
7393,There it is!
7394,Let us be brief. The others are waiting.
7395,"Well done, Ryne. Now to end this."
7396,"We're coming for you, Vauthry!"
7397,You call this a paradise? Don't make me laugh!
7398,Vauthry! I won't let you hurt anyone anymore!
7399,This time he will not escape.
7400,"Oh dear, you made her mad. You're in for it now."
7401,"Well, that made short work of them!"
7402,Now that's what I call a helping hand!
7403,Th-The Talos's hand!
7404,"Consider me impressed, Master Chai."
7405,Let us take care of the rest!
7406,That affords us some room to breathe.
7407,"Hah, as if they were flies!"
7408,Such precision of movement...
7409,A blow struck for all who suffered under you!
7410,"Aye, let's make the most of it!"
7411,Like one of the guardians of Amdapor...
7412,"Ah, this fellow again. Just like old times."
7413,Is this an illusion too!?
7414,I'm not afraid... I'm not afraid...
7415,"Oh, come now. We know this is an illusion."
7416,This wouldn't fool a child.
7417,Good thing I'm light on my feet.
7418,W-We're supposed to cross this?
7419,One step at a time...
7420,This shan't trouble us.
7421,An asinine trick.
7422,Makes me feel dirty just to look at it...
7423,Ahhh! It's hideous!
7424,Sickening...
7425,A voidsent? Or yet another illusion?
7426,I grow weary of these tricks!
7427,Whose likeness could this be?
7428,This isn't like before. This time I'll fight too.
7429,This must be Vauthry's hound.
7430,But this time I'll fight too!
7431,I should like to study their link to the statues on the Source.
7432,Nice to finally settle that old score.
7433,No more running away!
7434,Vauthry will need more than that to stop us.
7435,"We did it, Thancred!"
7436,"Aye, nice to finally settle that old score."
7437,A palace? Did Vauthry build this?
7438,A gaudy palace... How like Vauthry.
7439,All this via aetherial manipulation? Impressive...
7440,"Hmph, the man's vanity knows no bounds."
7441,We must be getting close.
7442,A cube-shaped eater. Perfect for blocking the way.
7443,What is that cube?
7444,I'm just going to assume that cube is an eater.
7445,"Its form notwithstanding, I believe that is a sin eater."
7446,Have care. It harbors a prodigious amount of aether.
7447,There is much we do not know about sin eaters.
7448,"Phew, that was tougher than it looked..."
7449,I leave the cartridges to you!
7450,And there I thought I'd seen them all.
7451,"By my reckoning, it was an elemental made eater."
7452,As the old adage goes.
7453,No amount of splendor will make you king!
7454,"Oh, I look forward to shutting him up!"
7455,This place really isn't to my taste.
7456,"If you're righteous, why did you run?"
7457,A good thing we are here to tear it down.
7458,This Light... Vauthry channels it into his minions!
7459,Looks like it had enough.
7460,"He made them stronger, the bastard!"
7461,The sin eaters partake of their master's power...
7462,This surging aether... Vauthry empowers his minions!
7463,"So much Light! Be careful, everyone!"
7464,Vauthry deigns to send us his favorite.
7465,I'll take that to mean that we're close!
7466,Its Light... It's blinding!
7467,Such aether... It could be a Warden in its own right!
7468,So it's a bigger candle than most. We'll snuff it out.
7469,"So, this was their calamity..."
7470,So much destruction...
7471,Off it goes... It seems we must do more to earn the crown.
7472,Nothing to it.
7473,It's just too terrible...
7474,I see storms of emotion...<hex:02100103>The aether here is seething with it.
7475,"Steady, Ryne!<hex:02100103>Remember: this is only a recreation!"
7476,Watch where you step!<hex:02100103>Ware the falling flames!
7477,"I know the beasts are eye-catching, but keep watch for those meteors!"
7478,"A city burneth 'neath fiery skies, and calamitous beasts hold sway..."
7479,It's like seeing the stars fall from the sky...
7480,...Like the pages of a myth come to life.
7481,This first doom seemed deadly enough not to warrant a second...
7482,Everyone all right?
7483,Even knowing it's all illusion makes it no less terrifying...
7484,Time for another type of ammunition.
7485,...And that was but the first doom they faced?
7486,A horror to beget an even greater abomination...
7487,The buildings are coming down!
7488,There goes a tower! We'll run out of walkway at this rate...
7489,Creation magicks run rampant...<hex:02100103>'Tis the stuff of nightmares.
7490,Watch out!<hex:02100103>We'll be lucky not to get crushed...
7491,"Nay, he will make certain we see it all. He wants us to see..."
7492,This is almost too much to witness...but witness it we must.
7493,Seven hells! These beasts lurk behind every stone!
7494,The Ascians suffered such tragedy...
7495,"To die by fire, or by fang..."
7496,This beast falleth short of the legend.
7497,"Aye, and we'd best keep moving if we're to avoid a similar fate."
7498,A terror of a different hue...
7499,"Is this another of these dooms, then?"
7500,A man's face on a bird's body...<hex:02100103>How unsettling.
7501,A creature born of madness...
7502,The form fear taketh is unlike to be pleasing.
7503,<pant> Is it...<pant>...over...?
7504,<pant> Was that...the last of them...?
7505,The beasts are links in a chain of fear...yet we seem to have broken it.
7506,These battles test the boundaries of our stamina...
7507,We did it! We won!
7508,"This time, mayhap. I worry we might not outlast the next."
7509,Have we ascended into the heavens themselves!?
7510,Gods! This place defies understanding!
7511,I-Is that the star!?<hex:02100103>The whole world is ablaze...
7512,"Ah, Master Matoya...<hex:02100103>If only you could see this..."
7513,"We perceive the scene from the heavens, as the Ascians did."
7514,"The final doom...<hex:02100103>The largest was saved for last, it seems."
7515,I don't care how monstrous it is! We end this now!
7516,Ignore my trembling!<hex:02100103>I can fight! I've made my choice...
7517,"This is the final doom, yes? Then let us be about defeating it!"
7518,Ryne! How are you holding up?
7519,I can do this! <hex:021A020203>We<hex:021A020103> can do this! Together!
7520,"Oh gods, that sin eater...<hex:02100103>It can't be..."
7521,Look! Over there...<hex:02100103>Does it yet hunt for prey?
7522,They're even turning the bears!?
7523,The eaters corrupt everything...
7524,They've been bolstering their numbers...
7525,They swell their ranks with wild beasts...
7526,I fear for the village. Let us make short work of these!
7527,I knew it!<hex:02100103>That's the eater from Amh Araeng!
7528,Ready yourselves!<hex:02100103>This is no lesser spawn!
7529,We'll not slip past this one. To arms!
7530,This is the monster we saw in Amh Araeng!
7531,"Easy now, Alisaie.<hex:02100103>We face it together!"
7532,Blasted fiend...<hex:02100103>Let's keep moving!
7533,"No match for us, it seems..."
7534,"The fiend is slain.<hex:02100103>Let us press on, shall we?"
7535,Is everyone alright?
7536,We're fine!<hex:02100103>Let's keep moving...
7537,"Look, there are still survivors!"
7538,"Wait, those are villagers!"
7539,Survivors!<hex:02100103>We must buy them time to flee!
7540,Go! Take refuge in the Crystarium!
7541,Have the gods no mercy...?
7542,Steel your hearts.<hex:02100103>There may be others we can save.
7543,...This slaughter must be answered.
7544,"Aye, we draw the eaters to us!"
7545,I wondered where you went...
7546,It seems confused.<hex:02100103>It must be newly turned...
7547,We leave none behind us. Put it down.
7548,Another eater!
7549,"...So, this is where you went."
7550,Tesleen...<hex:02100103>Be at peace.

7600,Understood.
7601,Grrroooaaarrr!
7602,I'm retreating for the moment!

7698,Well done!

7753,My thanks!
7754,Back in the game!
7755,I owe you one!
7756,I have you now!
7757,How's this?
7758,En garde!
7759,You underestimate me!
7760,Let's give them a show!
7761,With heart and steel!
7762,On your feet!
7763,I'll handle the healing!
7764,Pay me back later!
7765,Let's give it our all!
7766,Right behind you!
7767,I'm full of surprises!
7768,There'll be nothing left of you but a smoking crater!
7769,Is that all?
7770,Not good...
7771,This is going well...
7772,I owe you one!
7773,"Right, back to it!"
7774,Where were we?
7775,Do your worst!
7776,You're mine!
7777,Prepare yourself!
7778,We will not yield!
7779,My turn!
7780,Try and stop me!
7781,Are you all right!?
7782,Steady!
7783,I've got you!
7784,Keep your guard up!

7786,Come on!
7787,The best defense is a <hex:021A020203>good<hex:021A020103> defense!
7788,Must hold on...
7789,This isn't good...
7790,Oh no...
7791,Thank you.
7792,It's not over yet!
7793,That was close.
7794,Now I've got you!
7795,There!
7796,Take this!
7797,I'll show you!
7798,You underestimate me!
7799,Now or never!
7800,Don't worry. I've got you.
7801,Are you all right?
7802,We have to hold on.
7803,Keep it up!
7804,We <hex:021A020203>can<hex:021A020103> do this!
7805,Here we go.
7806,Oracle... Give me strength!
7807,This bodeth ill...
7808,Our enemy is...formidable.
7809,I fear...my strength...
7810,My thanks.
7811,I shall not yield.
7812,Our fates are not yet sealed.
7813,Now!
7814,Make ready!
7815,Begone!
7816,"O radiant starlight, become my blade!"
7817,Behold the heavens' brilliance!
7818,"All that I have and more, I bring to bear!"
7819,The stars shall grant thee succor.
7820,"Hold fast, friend."
7821,Thy time hath not yet come.
7822,I shall protect thee.
7823,Together we shall overcome this.
7824,We must see this through.
7825,"Oh Mother Hydaelyn, grant us succor that we may rise anew!"
7826,This is not over!
7827,I cannot fall. Not here.
7828,I'm not done yet!
7829,Someone will pay for that!
7830,That was embarrassing.
7831,Thank you.
7832,The gloves are off!
7833,You will not escape!
7834,Away with you!
7835,I will end this farce!
7836,I will not hold back!
7837,This is going to leave a mark!
7838,Be more careful!
7839,It was nothing.
7840,Don't be so reckless.
7841,Hold nothing back!
7842,May the Twelve guide you!
7843,Victory will be ours!
7844,You will rue the day you crossed my path!
7845,This cannot continue...
7846,A heroic last stand!
7847,What is life without struggle?
7848,'Tis not my day to die...
7849,Forgive me.
7850,Back to the fight!
7851,If I must.
7852,Very well.
7853,So be it!
7854,You may be surprised by what I can do...
7855,This villain is not without his tricks!
7856,The time has come!
7857,'Tis not my day to die...
7858,You'll live.
7859,No need for thanks.
7860,Might this help?
7861,Focus on the task at hand!
7862,I'm with you!
7863,May the power of the Crystal keep us from harm!
7864,May the Crystal's fire rain down upon our foe!
7865,May the Crystal's mercy mend our hurts!
7866,Come on!
7867,We're losing ground!
7868,We can't die here!
7869,Thank you.
7870,That will not happen again.
7871,You have my gratitude!
7872,No mercy!
7873,Now!
7874,Leave this to me!
7875,For the Crystarium!
7876,You have no idea!
7877,I'll handle this!
7878,Don't say I didn't warn you!
7879,Why do you persist in this folly?
7880,When will you learn?
7881,Vanity...
7882,"Beast of my blood, answer my call!"
7883,Rend my foes and ward their blows.
7884,Fall!
7885,Begone!
7886,For Lord Vauthry!
7887,Fools to a man!
7888,Out of my way!
7889,Die!
7890,No quarter!
7891,It's over!
7892,You would be wise to fear me!
7893,And you presume to be her protector. Pathetic!
7894,The enemy is strong.
7895,This ends now!
7896,No mercy!
7897,You brought this upon yourself!
7898,Fight through it!
7899,Here I come!
7900,Take this! And that! And this!
7901,I have something special in store for you!
7902,We must...keep fighting...
7903,Let us see how you handle this!
7904,No holding back!
7905,You will not get away!
7906,You think...this is funny!?
7907,Toodle-oo!
7908,Shall we prance!?
7909,Show's over!

7976,Damn that blasted tree!
7977,Why will it not die!?
7978,It fought as if possessed...
7979,I hope we never have to face a foe like that again.
7980,Mustn't...give up!
7981,Hmm... Nothing out of the ordinary.
7982,Look! Spiders!
7983,Gods be good... There are too many of them!
7984,There is nothing we can do. Retreat!
7985,To think the Children could raise such beasts...
7986,The Children and their vile pets deserve each other!
7987,"Poison spreads just like a disease, doesn't it?"
7988,Why do the birds keep eating them!?
7989,Perhaps I need a better plan of action...
7990,"The place looks much tidier now, if nothing else."
7991,"A few more of these, and I think we consider the job done."
7992,"Have you found any? If so, give them to me!"
7993,"There are things I'd rather be doing, I assure you!"
7994,"If the flamingos have swallowed any fragments, we'll need to retrieve those, too!"
7995,Forward!
7996,Ungh! A whole pack of them!
7997,We cannot let them near Slitherbough!
7998,Too many of them...
7999,Fall back! We must call for reinforcements!
8000,They are fleeing!
8001,Slitherbough is safe. For now.
8002,"Everyone, to arms!"
8003,That should be enough for now.
8004,"Yes, 'tis a bounteous harvest indeed."
8005,Who goes there!?
8006,We are come to deliver you unto darkness eternal...
8007,There is no escape from death!
8008,Children of the Everlasting Dark...
8009,"In death, you will find salvation!"
8010,We...made it.
8011,"Let us return, before we are waylaid any further."
8012,"If you value your life, flee while you still can!"
8013,A moment's hesitation and she will tear you apart!
8014,It is no use...
8015,I can only pray she forgets about me...
8016,KHREEEEEE!
8017,Forgive me...
8018,The beast is slain!
8019,I think I can make it back by myself. Thank you.
8020,Put down as many as you can!
8021,Gizamaluks! A whole horde of them!
8022,They must be looking for a place to nest.
8023,We must keep them away from the ruins!
8024,Fly like the wind!
8025,They only gather like this when preparing to nest.
8026,Now there is nothing to stop them from defiling the ruins.
8027,This is all our fault...
8028,Let us withdraw for now and try to find another way.
8029,Do you think we have seen the last of them?
8030,"Begone, foul beasts!"
8031,Come. Let us continue our patrol.
8032,Where are my sisters when I need them?
8033,Why must they take so many!?
8034,We shall need to guard this entrance more carefully from now on.
8035,"Thank you, for all you have done."
8036,"Is that all of them, I wonder?"
8037,Do you have any more of the artifacts?
8038,"If you find any more, please give them to me!"
8039,The wood raiders still have some of the relics!
8040,"They may only be deer, but do not underestimate them!"
8041,I wish you would stop worrying!
8042,Would you care to join me on a hunt?
8043,I would love to!
8044,If you will have me...
8045,"You have been practicing for this moment, have you not?"
8046,"Well, yes..."
8047,I will try not to disappoint you.
8048,You worry overmuch. Just remember your training.
8049,Understood!
8050,Look... Do you see them?
8051,Yes...
8052,Perhaps it was too soon for you.
8053,"Salmet, to me!"
8054,Ungh...
8055,I did it!
8056,With a little help from our friend here.
8057,"Yes, and I am very thankful."
8058,"When next we hunt, you shall face your prey alone."
8059,Very good...
8060,Aim ahead of your target!
8061,Watch their movements!
8062,The Eye of Gatorl...
8063,But what is it doing here?
8064,Is it possessed!?
8065,It must have mistaken us for intruders...
8066,We had best inform the others.
8067,Is it over?
8068,Perhaps we need to replace the core.
8069,What is it doing!?
8070,"Ox'Gatorl, hear our prayer! Stop this madness!"
8071,Have at you!
8072,This ends now!
8073,"No, not yet..."
8074,I have failed...
8075,Hyaaah!
8076,We shall not succumb to the likes of you!
8077,How could I have been so foolish!?
8078,Not like this...
8079,In death is salvation!
8080,Allow me!
8081,May my aim be straight and true!
8082,I have been careless...
8083,I have not the strength...
8084,You cannot hope to defeat us!
8085,"My, my! Stubborn, aren't you?"
8086,Is this the end?
8087,I have nothing left to give...
8088,Accept your fate!
8089,Why deny your fate!?
8090,The darkness calls to me...
8091,Your time is close at hand...
8092,None shall save you!
8093,"Darkness, take me!"
8094,The moment I have been waiting for...
8095,Ah! Aaargh!
8096,It burns!
8097,<pant> <pant>
8098,Over here!
8099,Draw it away from Editha!
8100,Keep fighting!
8101,Get the wounded to safety!
8102,You'll be alright!
8103,I couldn't...save them...
8104,"When all else is dust, I shall remain."
8105,"The earth opens up to claim you, mortal."
8106,The world shall tremble!
8107,Pitiful!
8108,Gaaaaaah!
8109,"I must sssay, it has been much harder to fish of late."
8110,Can I interessst you in some work?
8111,We ssstill need more pearls.
8112,"When the clutchmother is happy, all of us are happy."
8113,What a paltry ssselection of pearls!
8114,"Yesss, this should sssuffice."
8115,"Ssso, will you help me?"
8116,I need as much coral as I can carry!
8117,No sssuch thing as too much!
8118,Thank you! Now for the next part of the plan.
8119,Oh dear...thisss will never do.
8120,Lots of coral!
8121,<snarl>
8122,<growl>
8123,Awooo!
8124,Gehehe...
8125,<whimper>
8126,<pant> <pant>
8127,<roar>
8128,Grrrrrr...
8129,Wargs! To arms!
8130,Do not waver!<hex:02100103>Defend the Round!
8131,"Your fashion sense<hex:02100103>is bad, and you<hex:02100103>should feel bad!"
8132,All that lives<hex:02100103>will someday die!
8133,Your face! It's<hex:02100103>breaking my immersion!
8134,Oh! I don't like this!
8135,Not on my watch!
8136,Enough of this!
8137,I'm taking you in for questioning.
8138,0
8139,No time to catch our breath...
8140,Hold fast.
8141,Thisss way!
8142,There shhhould be plenty in this cave!
8143,I hope we do not encounter any...trouble.
8144,Trouble! And so sssoon!
8145,We mean you no harm!
8146,Shhhould be around here...
8147,Benthos! What are you doing here!?
8148,What could they be after?
8149,Ah!
8150,I will not die so easily!
8151,Shhhaaagh!
8152,Mussst not give up...
8153,"Not good!<hex:02100103>Hold on, I'm coming!"
8154,Only death awaits...
8155,I can sssmell those shhhells from here!
8156,"Thisss way, finless one!"
8157,Break!
8158,Oof!
8159,"Please, we come in peace!"
8160,"Watch your footing, finlesss one!"
8161,Ssso much for sssneaking in!
8162,More of them?
8163,Perhaps thisss was a bad idea?
8164,"Hopefully, that was the lassst of them. Many thanksss!"
8165,"<gasp> Why, I never!"
8166,"Well, I suppose<hex:02100103>you're not <hex:021A020203>wrong<hex:021A020103>..."
8167,What a waste<hex:02100103>of my time...
8168,I don't even<hex:02100103>know why I care!
8169,Is that...Lugarhoo? <hex:021A020203>Shite.<hex:021A020103>
8170,That <hex:021A020203>thing<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>is still alive!?
8171,I-I've never been<hex:02100103>so scared in<hex:02100103>all my life...
8172,To think that<hex:02100103>was once a man...
8173,...RUN!
8174,Today's catch<hex:02100103>smells a bit...riper<hex:02100103>than usual.
8175,"Wait, that's not<hex:02100103>the stink of fish!"
8176,Aaaugh! Anemones!
8177,I heard screams!<hex:02100103>Are you─<hex:02100103>what's that smell?
8178,Save...the fish...
8179,Draw your weapons!<hex:02100103>And try not to breathe!
8180,I can't take it...
8181,I'm going to be sick...
8182,My poor fish...
8183,The smell is gone!<hex:02100103>Or my nose has<hex:02100103>stopped working!
8184,"I'll take either,<hex:02100103>at this point.<hex:02100103>...Wait, what's that?"
8185,"Aaaugh, giant lizard!"
8186,I guess <hex:021A020203>its<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>nose still works...
8187,It certainly seems<hex:02100103>angry enough!
8188,<pant> Let's leave<hex:02100103>before anything<hex:02100103>else shows up.
8189,It's too strong!<hex:02100103>Grab the fish<hex:02100103>and run!
8190,Face me!
8191,There!
8192,Come!
8193,Of all the bloody...
8194,That the best you can...
8195,No... I can't...
8196,You fool...
8197,"No, not yet..."
8198,I'm so sorry...
8199,One shot...is all I need!
8200,0
8201,The treasure is mine! All mine!
8202,0
8203,It was mine...mine...
8204,Must find...the ship...<hex:02100103>Forget the crew...
8205,Huh!?
8206,What!?
8207,What did I do to<hex:02100103>deserve such attention?
8208,"Leave me alone, Lanbyrd!"
8209,Just die already!
8210,"Your fight is with me, Andreia!"
8211,Stay <hex:021A020203>right<hex:021A020103> there!
8212,"Right, let them have it!"
8213,Nothing out of<hex:02100103>the ordinary...
8214,...Aaand I spoke<hex:02100103>too soon.
8215,"Massive draco. Right.<hex:02100103>Here we go, then!"
8216,Ungh...
8217,I am ssscared!
8218,"Get away, fiend!"
8219,"You can do it, finlesss one!"
8220,Impresssive!
8221,How many can there be!?
8222,Perhapsss this was a bad idea!
8223,"Yesss, like that!"
8224,Watch out!
8225,They may be lurking in the shhhadows!
8226,I am not well-sssuited to all of this violence!
8227,Relying on finlesss ones... Dessspicable!
8228,We had bessst retreat!
8229,...
8230,Hammers away!
8231,"<hex:021A020203>Annoying<hex:021A020103>, I tell you."
8232,Ha!
8233,I could use some help...
8234,Yaaah!
8235,And...now!
8236,Can't...move...
8237,Weakling! You dare shhhow your face!?
8238,The coral is ours!
8239,Shhhluuurgh!
8240,You are a fool to challenge usss!
8241,Finlesss coward! You are next!
8242,Shhhah!
8243,"Die, die!"
8244,Ssscream for me!
8245,Maybe charging the<hex:02100103>huge draco was<hex:02100103>a <hex:021A020203>bad<hex:021A020103> idea...
8246,But I can't<hex:02100103><huff> just let it<hex:02100103>run amok...
8247,We did it!<hex:02100103>I can't thank<hex:02100103>you enough!
8248,New idea─<hex:021A020203>run<hex:021A020103>!
8249,"Hardly palatial,<hex:02100103>but could be worse."
8250,"In spittin' distance<hex:02100103>of the Crystarium, too."
8251,Maybe our prey'll come to us!
8252,That was fast.
8253,"Crystarium dogs, eh?"
8254,Suits me just fine!
8255,Time to cut and run!
8256,But don't think<hex:02100103>your petty <hex:021A020203>heroism<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>will save you.
8257,You thralls to morality<hex:02100103>are pathetic.
8258,Leave Lakeland to<hex:02100103>the true sinners.
8259,Did you hear that?
8260,Damn you!
8261,Did you find something?
8262,I think I heard─<hex:02100103>There! It's them!
8263,Nightshade!? And so<hex:02100103>close to the Crystarium...
8264,Drop your weapons!
8265,These lands are not<hex:02100103>yours to claim!
8266,Seems we're rid of<hex:02100103>them for the time being.
8267,Pray we don't happen<hex:02100103>upon any more.
8268,We're taking too<hex:02100103>many losses! Retreat!
8269,"You're already damned,<hex:02100103>understand!?"
8270,So...die!
8271,Yah!
8272,Piss off!
8273,What's going on here?
8274,"Ah, the guard! Help!"
8275,What a lovely cave!
8276,Draw your weapons!<hex:02100103>We've got company!
8277,"Crystarium's got plenty<hex:02100103>of fools to playact<hex:02100103>the hero, I see."
8278,Always did love<hex:02100103>a good farce!
8279,"The bloodier, the better!"
8280,Just know that<hex:02100103>you will never<hex:02100103>have won.
8281,Retreat!
8282,We are Nightshade<hex:02100103>and we will <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>be forgotten!
8283,This blighted world is<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>our<hex:021A020103> inheritance.
8284,The report mentioned<hex:02100103>this area...
8285,There! Nightshade!
8286,Were they waiting for us?
8287,No time to worry<hex:02100103>about it now!
8288,We managed to<hex:02100103>drive them off.
8289,Retreat and regroup!
8290,Hyaaa!
8291,Not bad for an antique...
8292,Ungh... I felt that one.
8293,Let me take care of that!
8294,Hells' bells...
8295,We mustn't give up!
8296,You are testing my patience.
8297,This calls for Garlean firepower!
8298,"Die, savages!"
8299,How dare you!
8300,0
8301,There'll be nothing left to bury!
8302,"Radovan, take my aether!"
8303,So it's come to this...<hex:02100103>No choice but to use Final Bastion!
8304,It...held strong.
8305,They have our cousin!<hex:02100103>Release the TERROR!
8306,Gears oiled!
8307,Screws tightened!
8308,She's beautiful!
8309,Witness the dawn of a new era!
8310,A marvel of dwarven ingenuity!
8311,Fire the forges! Tonight we<hex:02100103>build an army!
8312,Turn all dials to 11!
8313,GRRRRRR!
8314,Graaah!
8315,"Brave adventurers, enkindle the flames of the Bombard with your dance!"
8316,All that work!<hex:02100103>Reduced to rubble!
8317,Did anyone bother<hex:02100103>to draft blueprints?
8318,We'll be back! Just you wait!
8319,Of all the times for them to appear!
8320,"Right on top of the tracks, too..."
8321,No choice but to kill them all. Or have sssomeone else do it...
8322,Could you help me?
8323,I cannot ssstand dagons!
8324,Ssscruuuh...
8325,Sluuurshhh...
8326,Thank you! Now to investigate those tracks.
8327,These marks were left by some sort of mouth... A very large one.
8328,These are the remains of itsss prey. This warrants a closer look...
8329,Is there no end to them!?
8330,"Alack, the timber<hex:02100103>is fighting back!"
8331,Fie upon these<hex:02100103>accursed trees!
8332,That is the biggest one I have ever ssseen!
8333,Benthos!
8334,"And that is Zumshs Aath Deepdread, the worst of them all!"
8335,I do not fancy our chances...
8336,We do not know unlesss we try!
8337,"Spirits of my ancessstors, watch over me!"
8338,"Red flakes, eh?"
8339,What could they be?
8340,To think that we could triumph over Zumshs Aath Deepdread!
8341,Now to examine these marks...
8342,Red fragments of sssome sort... Perhaps the ssstories were true?
8343,I was a fool to even attempt thisss!
8344,Yesss! Another ssstep closer to finding that beassst!
8345,Archaeotania shhhall be mine to command!
8346,Those finless ones shhhall pay!
8347,"Ssspineless weaklings, the lot of you! Retreat!"
8348,Pathetic!
8349,You dare challenge me!?
8350,Do not fall behind!
8351,"Oh, I remember now. Thisss is cubus territory..."
8352,Hmm... The coast ssseems clear.
8353,I shhhall make this quick!
8354,"Thanksss to you, I was able to gather some ussseful clues."
8355,It is a matter of time before I find Archaeotania!
8356,"Thisss way, I think..."
8357,Ack!
8358,Get away from me!
8359,Look there!
8360,Hm? What breaks<hex:02100103>through yonder─ AUGH!
8361,You seem awfully surprised.
8362,Did you think we'd<hex:02100103>just let you go<hex:02100103>on your merry way?
8363,
8364,Interesssting...
8365,"Ahem. As I harvested,<hex:02100103>lonely as a cloud─"
8366,"No, let me guess.<hex:02100103>You were attacked. Again."
8367,Will you require<hex:02100103>an escort back<hex:02100103>to the Crystarium?
8368,"Ah, chivalry!<hex:02100103>The truest art.<hex:02100103>Please do."
8369,"Stop, villain!"
8370,"Ow, I say!"
8371,That's what I get<hex:02100103>for being distracted...
8372,I can do no more.<hex:02100103>We must flee!
8373,I have not yet<hex:02100103>shuffled off this<hex:02100103>mortal coil? Huzzah!
8374,"For now, at least."
8375,We should make<hex:02100103>haste lest any<hex:02100103>more are about.
8376,As you like it!
8377,"Ha! That's right,<hex:02100103>run back to your<hex:02100103>precious refuge."
8378,"Take your “victory.”<hex:02100103>Just remember, you'll<hex:02100103>never be <hex:021A020203>safe.<hex:021A020103>"
8379,There's nowhere<hex:02100103>in this world<hex:02100103>you can run.
8380,Please don't eat me!
8381,This is how I die...

8383,"Lali-ho, lali-ho,♪<hex:02100103>It's off to work, I go.♪"
8384,Maybe I'll stumble across<hex:02100103>some ore on the way home...
8385,Tremble before the Sun!
8386,It is no good... The Cupsss are doomed...
8387,"Archaeotania, where are you!?"
8388,Look! I brought your favorite coral!
8389,Not when I am ssso close!
8390,"Be careful, finlesss one!"
8391,I must provide what succor I can...
8392,Ha ha! Thanksss for doing our job for usss!
8393,You think you have me beaten!?
8394,Release the hydrozoans!
8395,"Now go, as fast as you can!"
8396,Weak!
8397,Our allies will see you to safety!
8398,The Tempessst is ours!
8399,I think not!
8400,0
8401,"Back for more, Zumshs?"
8402,More of them!?
8403,"Oh dear, oh dear..."
8404,That was easier than I thought!
8405,We shhhall feed you to Archaeotania!
8406,You ssseek to control Archaeotania!?
8407,Requesting reinforcements...<hex:02100103>Requesting reinforcements...
8408,Shhhaaagh!
8409,Ssserves you right!
8410,I will not bow to the likes of you!
8411,Bleed!
8412,Shhhlaaargh!
8413,Die!
8414,Had enough!?
8415,Th-Thank you...
8416,Impressive!
8417,Hm... I may need<hex:02100103>some bigger cogs...
8418,And the actuator will<hex:02100103>require additional tuning...
8419,"Overall, I'd say this test<hex:02100103>was a rousing success!"
8420,"Ah, I'm bleeding again.<hex:02100103>Rather heavily!"
8421,<sigh> Hang on─<hex:02100103>I'll staunch the wound.
8422,And here come<hex:02100103>the dracones. Naturally.
8423,Oh dear!
8424,Don't mind me.<hex:02100103>Just being savaged<hex:02100103>by dracones here.
8425,Why does this<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>always<hex:021A020103> happen to me?
8426,That's the<hex:02100103>last of them!
8427,Don't worry─<hex:02100103>you'll be fine.

8462,"Oh, a visitor? Splendid, splendid!"
8463,"Perhaps you would be game for a game, yes?"
8464,I call it “Kill or Be Killed!”
8465,"The rules are, as you can imagine, rather simple..."
8466,Not interested? I can't say I blame you!

8482,Anyone hurt!?
8483,Come to me!
8484,Victory will be ours!
8485,No more games!
8486,Damn you!
8487,We've almost got him!
8488,Give it your all!
8489,Yaaah!
8490,Whee!

8498,"Quickly, the door!"
8499,Time to heal up!
8500,Move away!
8501,Go and be finlesss somewhere elssse!
8502,"Die, weakling!"
8503,"Fall, fall!"
8504,Shhhaaah!
8505,Take that!
8506,My curse will consume you from within!
8507,Flames take you!
8508,Ice claim you!
8509,Lightning rend you!
8510,Earth bind you!
8511,Starfire consume you!
8512,In life and in death<hex:02100103>I serve Ronka...
8513,Forever bound to this<hex:02100103>place by sacred pact...
8514,For the empire...<hex:02100103>For the emperor...
8515,I am sure thisss is the place.
8516,Perhapsss a bit farther?
8517,There it is!
8518,Ah! Zumshs Aath Deepdread!
8519,This is...not good.
8520,Those benthos beat us to it...
8521,Shhhaaah!
8522,I cannot give in!
8523,What happened here?<hex:02100103>Were you attacked?
8524,Who did this?
8525,"Who, you ask?"
8526,Who? Who!? Ahahaha...
8527,Oh... Oh no...
8528,Dammit!
8529,They're everywhere!
8530,"Hahaha! Oh, you<hex:02100103>righteous fools are<hex:02100103>too easy to snare."
8531,You're just so<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>predictable<hex:021A020203>. Ha...<hex:02100103>Haha... Ahahaha!
8532,You will never<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>belong<hex:021A020103> here.<hex:02100103>Not like us.
8533,Tch. We're done here.
8534,Keep your <hex:021A020203>peace<hex:021A020103>.<hex:02100103>It won't save you.
8535,"That could've gone<hex:02100103>much worse, if you<hex:02100103>hadn't come along."
8536,I ought to<hex:02100103>have known better.
8537,Nightshade never tires<hex:02100103>of dirty tricks.
8538,So much for that.
8539,Get moving. We<hex:02100103>don't have the time<hex:02100103>to waste here.
8540,What of the trap?
8541,There were...interlopers.
8542,"You made a<hex:02100103>hash of it, then?"
8543,"Look, we had<hex:02100103>the same problem<hex:02100103>with the strongholds..."
8544,Meddlers at every turn!
8545,The arrogance of<hex:02100103>the Crystarium's ignorant<hex:02100103>knows no bounds.
8546,"Well, we'll have to<hex:02100103>see to that."
8547,Let's make sure<hex:02100103>they get what's<hex:02100103>coming to them.
8548,These lands were<hex:02100103>always ours. Now<hex:02100103>more than ever.
8549,We are the<hex:02100103>true sinners!
8550,Fall before us!
8551,Archaeotania shhhall answer our prayers!
8552,The finlesss ones and their pathetic friends shhhall perish!
8553,The mighty one will sssup on your fleshhh!
8554,You would unleash that evil upon the Tempessst!?
8555,You go on ahead.<hex:02100103>I will hold them off here!
8556,How!? We had Archaeotania contained...
8557,You were lucky thisss time!
8558,<pant> I owe you...my life...
8559,I do believe it's time that I took center stage!
8560,0
8561,Have care. We know not what lies within...
8562,0
8563,Perhaps there's a pattern to their movements.
8564,0
8565,Careful.
8566,0
8567,So there is a pattern.
8568,0
8569,Mistress Nashmeira!
8570,0
8571,0
8572,0
8573,I must ask that you refrain from wandering...
8574,...and avoid any needless frolicking.
8575,"Oh, I wouldn't dream of it!<hex:02100103>La la la♪"
8576,"So, is it finished?"
8577,"It'll be finished when I say<hex:02100103>it's finished, and I say it's<hex:02100103>not finished! At least not yet."
8578,"Well, let me know when it is!<hex:02100103>I don't want to miss when we<hex:02100103>crush the Tholls!"
8579,TO SHREDS! TO SHREDS!
8580,Fraaagh!
8581,Hiiiiish!
8582,Braaaaaagh!
8583,Who goes there!?<hex:02100103>A Tholl spy!?
8584,Intruder detected...<hex:02100103>Intruder detected...
8585,Don't let him escape!
8586,Gulg's belly!<hex:02100103>They found me!
8587,Warning!<hex:02100103>Warning!
8588,Help! Someone! Anyone!<hex:02100103>I'm too short to die!
8589,Crush him!
8590,Go for the beard!
8591,Left! Right! Left!
8592,Not the beard! Not the beard!
8593,How is this fair!?
8594,You'll regret that!
8595,They've got us by the beard!<hex:02100103>To the hills!
8596,"Wait, you two!"
8597,That will teach you to<hex:02100103>stick your beard in Gogg<hex:02100103>business!
8598,You won't see me again!<hex:02100103>I swear it!
8599,These legs can only carry us<hex:02100103>so far. We must fight!
8600,Graaaaaaagh! Hraaaagh!
8601,"The battle is lost! Fall back, fall back!"
8602,"You rang, cousins?"
8603,Crush them all!
8604,I knew it! The Goggs are<hex:02100103>up to no good!
8605,0
8606,Where did they come from!?
8607,Ngah!
8608,Leave us alone!
8609,Any friend of the Tholls<hex:02100103>is an enemy of ours!
8610,Right in the stones!
8611,For the Goggs!
8612,Alright! Alright! I'll talk!
8613,Out of my sight!
8614,Let seep sorrow into your heart.
8615,Our secret weapon is<hex:02100103>almost complete!
8616,"You may have defeated us<hex:02100103>today, but tomorrow shall be ours!"
8617,Tell me your plan or I'll<hex:02100103>have your helm!
8618,A fitting death!
8619,Not if you're rotting in our gaol!
8620,We yield!
8621,"You wouldn't stab a dwarf<hex:02100103>in the back now, would you?"
8622,"Run today, live to<hex:02100103>fight another day!"
8623,Perish at my hands!
8624,You are no obstacle!
8625,There is nowhere to hide.
8626,You are out of your element!
8627,My rage knows no bounds!
8628,Zzz...
8629,<slurp> <snort>
8630,Mmmmmm...  Sacrilicious...
8631,"Wake up! Wake up, damn you!"
8632,What's the matter!?
8633,Some kind of sleeping powder?
8634,Why you!
8635,Try this!
8636,Don't get ahead of yourself!
8637,Hah!
8638,Yah!
8639,There!
8640,Have at them!
8641,Forward!
8642,Yaaargh!
8643,Leave them to us!
8644,No!
8645,Ungh...
8646,Ah!
8647,Hmph...
8648,Ah!
8649,Ugh...
8650,Unnngh...
8651,Oh!
8652,Confound it!
8653,I don't think I've ever seen anywhere so peaceful and serene.
8654,Ha ha! I will give it some thought.
8655,Wait! Don't run on ahead!
8656,This is all we need...
8657,"Oh, Gridania is a wonderful<hex:02100103>place indeed! You should<hex:02100103>stay a while."
8658,What was that all about?
8659,I hope Editha is all right!
8660,"Please, take good care of her."
8661,"If you require my assistance,<hex:02100103>do not hesitate to ask!"
8662,"Editha, you mustn't run off like that again!"
8663,Oh! You're no fun!
8664,Do you know who could<hex:02100103>be behind these attacks?
8665,No idea.
8666,Crazy people?
8667,"Yes, I think we've gathered that much..."
8668,What a beautiful day!
8669,Glad to see the threat of assassination has done little to dampen your mood.
8670,Are you alright?<hex:02100103>You've gone pale...
8671,Ah...<hex:02100103>Your eyes tell the tale.
8672,Alisaie?<hex:02100103>You've gone pale...
8673,...I'm fine.<hex:02100103>We should keep moving.
8674,Is death the only answer!?
8675,We were too slow to save them!
8676,"A waking nightmare, indeed..."
8677,We free their souls.<hex:02100103>That is all we can do...
8678,I feel my skin prickling.<hex:02100103>What is this boiling aether...?
8679,The manor house is just up ahead!
8680,We are close...<hex:02100103>Be on your guard!
8681,As is the source of this suffocating aether...
8682,The sheer power...<hex:02100103>I can sense its strength from here!
8683,Gods...<hex:02100103>This must be the Warden!
8684,...We stand in the presence of a Lightwarden.
8685,"Aye, this is the true scourge of Lakeland!"
8686,0
8687,Impressive.
8688,Nightshade...
8689,Are they preparing<hex:02100103>for an assault?
8690,Everyone at the ready!<hex:02100103>We strike first!
8691,How <hex:021A020203>noble<hex:021A020103> of you<hex:02100103>to come to us!
8692,We'll put you<hex:02100103>out of your misery!
8693,Now you see<hex:02100103>the futility of<hex:02100103>the <hex:021A020203>good<hex:021A020103>.
8694,The only glory<hex:02100103>is in sin!
8695,Only the wicked<hex:02100103>will walk these lands!
8696,There are too<hex:02100103>many of them!
8697,Maybe they were right...
8698,More of them!?<hex:02100103>Or...<hex:021A020203>no<hex:021A020103>...
8699,Wargs!
8700,<growl>
8701,Graaah!
8702,Ha! The binding worked!
8703,Tear their throats out!
8704,Lakeland is ours!
8705,Only the elves<hex:02100103>truly know this world<hex:02100103>we have created.
8706,You were never<hex:02100103>going to succeed.
8707,We just don't<hex:02100103>have the numbers...
8708,What will become<hex:02100103>of Lakeland now?
8709,So be it.<hex:02100103>You win.
8710,You'll get your<hex:02100103>deserts someday.
8711,<whimper>
8712,Should we give chase?
8713,"No, the wounded<hex:02100103>come first."
8714,I can't believe<hex:02100103>they had <hex:021A020203>wargs<hex:021A020103>...
8715,"Myalna, what are they?"
8716,"Echoes, I think. But there is something strange about them."
8717,"Bows, with me! We have work to do!"
8718,Understood!
8719,It seems that they are diseased.
8720,We must cull them before the sickness can spread.
8721,That will suffice.
8722,"Onward, sisters!"
8723,We have allowed too many of them to escape...
8724,Perhaps we will find some of them on our patrol.
8725,Bows! It is time to leave!
8726,I recognize that stench.
8727,Those crawlers must be what is spreading the disease!
8728,"My thoughts exactly. Sisters, you know what to do."
8729,That should put a stop to the disease.
8730,I certainly hope so!
8731,"We are running dangerously low on arrows, though."
8732,I suggest that we go and gather feathers for flights.
8733,We let too many of them get away.
8734,"Get back, you repulsive creature!"
8735,"Here, have another one!"
8736,Ugh! I hate crawlers!
8737,The tarichuks should be nearby.
8738,There they are!
8739,Such fine plumage.
8740,These tarichuks are tougher than they look...
8741,I had best stop there. No point dying for a bunch of feathers.
8742,This should suffice. Your assistance is much appreciated.
8743,That is enough for the time being.
8744,Have you any more feathers?
8745,I will take those feathers off of your hands!
8746,Bring me as many feathers as you can. It matters not how you get them.
8747,Keep your eyes peeled for trouble.
8748,"Myalna, look!"
8749,They are attacking the ancient guardian!
8750,How can this be!?
8751,To think that the ancient guardian could be defeated...
8752,There is little more we can do here. Let us return.
8753,It seems the danger has passed.
8754,Come. We must report this to the others.
8755,I have failed my sisters...
8756,Arrows at the ready!
8757,Did you hear that? It sounded like a roar...
8758,"If that is what I think it is, we must hurry!"
8759,There it is! Is that...Tojil!?
8760,Many a sister has died fighting that beast.
8761,Do not let it escape!
8762,It is heading towards the village!
8763,"Quickly, there is no time to lose!"
8764,We have it running for its life. Now is our chance!
8765,Aim for the eyes!
8766,"Sisters, we shall fight to the last!"
8767,The beast is angered!
8768,What is it doing!?
8769,I can feel the heat...
8770,This must be one of its defenses.
8771,"Do not get too close, sisters!"
8772,We are outmatched...
8773,The tide has turned!
8774,After it!
8775,Now we have it cornered...
8776,Your reign of terror has lasted long enough.
8777,"It ends here, fiend!"
8778,Charge!
8779,So close...
8780,"Finally, the beast is dead."
8781,May the fallen rest in peace.
8782,Is it really over?
8783,"For now. Though Tojil is slain, our work is never done."
8784,Let us return to the village.
8785,Myalna!
8786,"Please, you must fall back!"
8787,I have you now!
8788,We cannot allow the disease to spread!
8789,Time to end this.
8790,Get them away from the ancient guardian!
8791,Those that threaten the forest must perish!
8792,Why will you not die!?
8793,Enough of this!
8794,Fall!
8795,We win or we die!
8796,"Die, fiend!"
8797,Your end is nigh!
8798,My sisters... I am sorry...
8799,Ungh...
8800,'Tis but a flesh wound...
8801,"Fall back for now, sister."
8802,Keep your guard up!
8803,There is no turning back.
8804,"Careful, mortal!<hex:02100103>The bees are<hex:02100103>everywhere..."
8805,"It's not much,<hex:02100103>but I'm <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>going over there..."
8806,"In fact, let's leave.<hex:02100103>Quickly. Yes."
8807,That's a relief!
8808,"This seems like<hex:02100103>enough, surely?"
8809,I'll just start<hex:02100103>backing away slowly...
8810,Augh! It<hex:02100103>looked at me!
8811,Is that one...<hex:02100103>getting closer?
8812,The pixies haven't<hex:02100103>spotted us.
8813,The pixies haven't<hex:02100103>spotted us.
8814,You <hex:021A020203>hope<hex:021A020103>.
8815,Let's get the<hex:02100103>herbs and go.
8816,What have we here?
8817,"Foolish, foolish mortals!"
8818,Ack!
8819,Told you so.
8820,Please...<hex:02100103>My friend─he'll die<hex:02100103>without these!
8821,"Oh, what a pity!"
8822,But you'll have<hex:02100103>so much more<hex:02100103>fun with us!
8823,"You there!<hex:02100103>Help us, please!"
8824,And...there!
8825,Waugh!
8826,<sigh>...
8827,Now don't you<hex:02100103>look lovely?
8828,Hee hee... Ahahaha!
8829,Somebody! Save meee!
8830,A shrub? Really?
8831,Spoilsports...
8832,"Oh, thank you!"
8833,Now we can get<hex:02100103>what we came for.
8834,Be quick about it.
8835,Tee hee!
8836,Time to play...
8837,I can't go back<hex:02100103>without the nectar...
8838,"At last, I can<hex:02100103>go home and─"
8839,Hm?
8840,"Eek, giant bird!"
8841,"Oh no, <hex:021A020203>Rukh<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>the giant bird!"
8842,AAAAAAH!
8843,You did it!
8844,I owe you my life!
8845,I am <hex:021A020203>never<hex:021A020103> doing<hex:02100103>nectar duty again...
8846,Get them<hex:02100103>away from me!
8847,"If I didn't need that<hex:02100103>nectar, I swear..."
8848,Eep!
8849,No no no no no...
8850,Phew!
8851,Now I can get to the<hex:02100103>Bookman's Shelves.
8852,"Nectar, here I come!"
8853,"Eek, stay back!"
8854,"Oh, this is <hex:021A020203>awful<hex:021A020103>."
8855,"Hello, pixies!<hex:02100103>It's time to <hex:021A020203>play.<hex:021A020103>"
8856,Who─ Oh. Oh no.
8857,What <hex:021A020203>ever<hex:021A020103> shall<hex:02100103>we do today?
8858,"Well, I cannot<hex:02100103>but notice..."
8859,"...those darling pixies, yes?"
8860,They do look<hex:02100103>ever so peaceful...
8861,"...and that won't do,<hex:02100103>will it now?"
8862,This can't be good.
8863,"Hmm, I believe<hex:02100103>it is time we<hex:02100103>took our leave."
8864,We would thank<hex:02100103>you for the fun...
8865,...if only you<hex:02100103>weren't quite<hex:02100103>so dull!
8866,"Why, I never!"
8867,Come on!<hex:02100103>We give chase!
8868,"Such ill-humored folk, here!"
8869,I daresay we<hex:02100103>shall find better<hex:02100103>sport elsewhere.
8870,"Right you are, Brother!"
8871,They're doubtless off<hex:02100103>to trouble some<hex:02100103>other poor soul.
8872,I'll keep an eye on them.
8873,"Ul An, wait!"
8874,I knew it!
8875,"My, my, look at that..."
8876,If it isn't an amaro!
8877,"Remind me, Brother..."
8878,...how amaro fare<hex:02100103>against gliders?
8879,We shall have<hex:02100103>to find out!
8880,Indeed we shall!
8881,"A wee bit of<hex:02100103>this, and...yes!"
8882,Oh dear. Are<hex:02100103>you quite alright?
8883,"I say! That's<hex:02100103>rather painful, sir!"
8884,That amaro...<hex:02100103>definitely needs help.
8885,I suppose we<hex:02100103>have our answer.
8886,"Too quickly, alas..."
8887,So on to the next!
8888,It wasn't even a<hex:02100103>funny prank! Unacceptable!
8889,You again?
8890,We are not amused...
8891,...or are we?
8892,Perhaps you'll never know...
8893,Thank you kindly.
8894,Are you alright?
8895,"Honestly, those Daens!"
8896,They're not amused?<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>I'm<hex:021A020103> not amused...
8897,There!
8898,Our usual games grow tiresome...
8899,Perhaps this fellow<hex:02100103>can be of assistance.
8900,You... You're the Daens...
8901,"My, my..."
8902,...what nice boxes you have!
8903,Not the boxes!
8904,Nooo! My herbs!
8905,"Oh, dear, would<hex:02100103>you look at that..."
8906,Such a mess!
8907,It will take <hex:021A020203>ages<hex:021A020103><hex:02100103>to collect more...
8908,What a shame!
8909,Oooh... Enough is enough!
8910,Thank goodness!
8911,Our persistent pixie.<hex:02100103>What a lovely surprise!
8912,You stop this nonsense at once!
8913,Hmm. We might consider it...
8914,...if you can catch us!
8915,Get back here!
8916,"Oho, they seem<hex:02100103>to be keeping up."
8917,This could be quite fun...
8918,Shall we give them a chance?
8919,Stop right there!
8920,"Perhaps a test, first?"
8921,"Yes, a test!"
8922,A magicked tree?<hex:02100103>What do you take me for?
8923,Ack!
8924,If we were to be honest...
8925,...that was a disappointment.
8926,But there is time for sport yet!
8927,That wasn't half bad.
8928,You are an entertaining lot indeed.
8929,And now we'll have words!
8930,"Oh, no. Not yet, I think!"
8931,But perhaps if you<hex:02100103>follow us south...
8932,...we'll exchange <hex:021A020203>something<hex:021A020103>.
8933,Hmph. I suppose I will.
8934,But I do hope<hex:02100103>they'll do better<hex:02100103>than a <hex:021A020203>tree<hex:021A020103>.
8935,Welcome!
8936,We are <hex:021A020203>so<hex:021A020103> pleased<hex:02100103>to have you here...
8937,Who wouldn't be?
8938,"Oh, you're a funny one."
8939,Much more entertaining<hex:02100103>than we expected.
8940,If only I could say<hex:02100103>the same for you.
8941,"Now, wait just a moment..."
8942,You haven't seen<hex:02100103>the half of us yet!
8943,Ha! Fuath tricks don't scare me!
8944,Marvelous!
8945,Now I teach you<hex:02100103>a thing or two!
8946,But wouldn't the Bookman's Shelves be a more appropriate venue?
8947,I thought you<hex:02100103>might say that!
8948,"So, we've had a chat..."
8949,...and it turns out we're not <hex:021A020203>quite<hex:021A020103> done...
8950,Naturally.
8951,Now <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103> is impressive!
8952,Absolutely delightful!
8953,"Now, if you'll just come this way..."
8954,Haha! The chase is on!
8955,"At this point, it seems only fair to mention..."
8956,...that you may not survive this.
8957,"And what might<hex:02100103>“this” be, hmm?"
8958,Just a bit of magic...
8959,...that we save for<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>very<hex:021A020103> special occasions.
8960,"<hex:021A020203>We'll<hex:021A020103> have great fun either way, of course."
8961,I don't doubt that.<hex:02100103>You have terrible taste.
8962,Oho! <hex:021A020203>That<hex:021A020103> is a first.
8963,Ready to admit defeat yet?
8964,While there's still fun to be had?
8965,Perish the thought!
8966,"One more round, then!"
8967,And now for the moment...
8968,...that <hex:021A020203>we've<hex:021A020103> been waiting for!
8969,Ahaha! Do your worst!
8970,Well!
8971,It's been quite some time...
8972,...since we've had such good sport!
8973,So...you're done?
8974,"Yes, that will do."
8975,You'll notice that you lost.
8976,"We did, at that."
8977,But what a loss it was!
8978,We really must do<hex:02100103>this again sometime!
8979,I concur!
8980,"Oh, if you insist."
8981,It's been fun!
8982,"Well, well!"
8983,It seems we are the victors!
8984,"The <hex:021A020203>cheaters<hex:021A020103>, more like!"
8985,We thank you for the diversion...
8986,...however brief it was!
8987,You could at least<hex:02100103><hex:021A020203>try<hex:021A020103> to fight back.
8988,"Oh, dear."
8989,"Oooh, that smarts."
8990,"A bit more savagery,<hex:02100103>if you please."
8991,Ohoho!
8992,Ahaha!
8993,You'll do.
8994,"Go on, then!"
8995,Chin up!
8996,Has one taken the lead?
8997,Brother!
8998,Are you quite alright?
8999,Haha!
9000,Hee hee!
9001,Hmm...
9002,"My, my..."
9003,Stop that!
9004,Honestly!
9005,Save the herbs!
9006,"Stop, stop!"
9007,Forgive me...
9008,<huff> <huff>
9009,Damn you!
9010,Ungh...
9011,This is Ran'jit...
9012,Argh!
9013,Graaarghhh!
9014,Hissssss!
9015,Ha!
9016,See that?
9017,Ouch! That looked painful!
9018,Those horrid bandits won't<hex:02100103>spoil my day!
9019,"You can do it, Darmal!"
9020,"Yes, like that, but better!"
9021,Take this!
9022,And this!
9023,No match for me!
9024,I'm not done yet!
9025,"Come along, Darmal!"
9026,Wait for me!
9027,"What's the hurry, anyway?"
9028,"And come to think of it, where are we going?"
9029,There are shinies waiting for us near Twitch!
9030,Bloody hells! Why there of all the places?
9031,Creatures burrow into the sand there!
9032,"Which would unearth buried treasure... Not a bad idea, I'll admit."
9033,This is the place!
9034,"You mentioned burrowing creatures, but I don't see any..."
9035,"Hold on, do you think they're still under the sand?"
9036,Mummy! Save me!
9037,I bloody knew it!
9038,"Get back, Rhal Ral! You'll only get in my way!"
9039,We've walked right into their trap!
9040,Darmal! It's no use!
9041,This is all your fault! Grrr... No choice but to run!
9042,"Had enough, eh? You sand-swallowing bastards!"
9043,"We are alive! But more importantly, where is that treasure?"
9044,Let me see...
9045,Hmm? A map! It looks like the Fields of Amber.
9046,There is a picture of a gigantender to the south...
9047,...And what looks like a necklace nearby.
9048,Then what are we waiting for?
9049,The treasure must be where gigantenders roam!
9050,"This way, Darmal!"
9051,What I wouldn't give for a moment's peace...
9052,We are almost there.
9053,Lizards. That's all we bloody need.
9054,We'd do well to steer clear of that lot.
9055,Of course! You know I am not one to take risks!
9056,"No, but I usually end up taking them in your place."
9057,"Oh, this is not good... But we must not give up!"
9058,Ungh... There's too many!
9059,Rhal Ral! Fancy lending a hand?
9060,Help is here!
9061,"Too little, too late..."
9062,Darmal! What are you doing!?
9063,Bugger the treasure! I'd rather be poor than dead!
9064,Do not leave me!
9065,"Thanks, mate. We'd be lizard food if it weren't for you."
9066,"Yes, yes! There will be time for that later! On with the treasure hunt!"
9067,"I don't see anything, though."
9068,"Maybe not the shinies, but look over there!"
9069,Footprints... Judging by the shape and stride length...
9070,"A gigantender, yes? Fresh, too!"
9071,It must be over two hundred years old!
9072,"If it was dormant when this map was made, they could have used it as a landmark!"
9073,They normally don't wander far from their territory...
9074,...So these tracks will probably lead to that necklace.
9075,Ah. I think we've found our gigantender.
9076,No doubt about it!
9077,We'll have to cut that thing down to size before we can start the search.
9078,"Show it what you are made of, Darmal!"
9079,"Argh! I can't give up, not when we're so close!"
9080,Better to run and scavenge another day!
9081,"How do you like that, you overgrown cactus!"
9082,We have found it! The treasure!
9083,What do we have here?
9084,So shiny!
9085,Wait... What's that!?
9086,Eeek!
9087,The necklace! Snatched away from us!
9088,That was Offscoursman! The sparkling must've caught its eye!
9089,"Quickly, before it escapes us!"
9090,"For once, we're of the same mind, Rhal Ral!"
9091,"It flew in this direction, yes?"
9092,Found it!
9093,Now all we have to do is kill it... Easier said than done.
9094,It's no good! Fall back!
9095,"It's too strong, Darmal!"
9096,Ha ha! The necklace is ours!
9097,Excellent work!
9098,"Now, let us take a closer look..."
9099,"Ah, yes. The mark of five coins. This was made for the Nabaath royal family!"
9100,"So it must be worth a fair bit, then?"
9101,Yes! I cannot wait to have it properly appraised!
9102,Let us make our way to Mord Souq!
9103,No arguments here!
9104,Our venture was a great success. Now to head to the hills!
9105,What!? I thought we were going home!
9106,"And we will, after a quick detour!"
9107,Here we are! The Hills of Amber!
9108,Erm... And what are we doing here?
9109,All will be revealed soon!
9110,I'd rather you just told me...
9111,"Somebody, help me!"
9112,Ha ha ha! Good luck with that!
9113,"In the desert, no one can hear you die!"
9114,We have to save him!
9115,Do we?
9116,"You're in the wrong place, at the wrong time."
9117,"Blame your own bad luck, mate."
9118,"Help, I say! These men are bandits!"
9119,"All right, don't get your breeches in a twist. You stay back, Rhal Ral."
9120,"Be careful, Darmal!"
9121,"Think you're a hero, do you?"
9122,"Keep out of this, old man!"
9123,Don't come any closer!
9124,"Job's done. Time to scarper, lads!"
9125,Not a bad haul!
9126,I'm sorry...
9127,"On second thought, let us forget the detour! Back to Mord Souq it is!"
9128,You haven't seen the last of us!
9129,Bugger this!
9130,Hold still and die!
9131,"Got some fight in you, eh?"
9132,Let's see how you like this!
9133,Good riddance!
9134,"Thank you, strangers. My name is Ingi, and I came here to find gemstones."
9135,"I am Rhal Ral, and this is my associate, Darmal."
9136,We are in search of treasure!
9137,In a place like this?
9138,Yes! I bought an old Ronso scroll...
9139,...which revealed the location of the Elderblade!
9140,"It's in the Hills of Amber, the traditional home of the Ronso. Do you know anything about it?"
9141,"I can't say I recognize the name, but the “Elder” part is familiar..."
9142,"Please, if you know something, you must tell us!"
9143,"Well, I am not sure it will be sufficient payment for saving my life, but I will do what I can."
9144,But do you mind if I stop by my house first?
9145,Of course not!
9146,I shan't keep you waiting long.
9147,"By all means, lead the way!"
9148,"It is good to be home, safe and sound."
9149,I will be with you in a few moments.
9150,Take your time. We're in no rush.
9151,But sooner is better than later!
9152,There they are!
9153,"This time, we won't go so easy on you!"
9154,"Back for a second helping, eh?"
9155,"Watch out, Darmal!"
9156,"Next time we see you, you're dead!"
9157,Revenge at last!
9158,Rhal Ral! Are you all right!?
9159,"No, not really..."
9160,Sorry to keep you wa─
9161,Where did they go?
9162,Gods be good! Did those bandits come back!?
9163,"Go on, run, you bunch of milksops! Rhal Ral, are you hurt?"
9164,Only physically.
9165,Thank you for waiting. Is everything all right?
9166,It is now!
9167,"I am glad to hear it. Shall we go and find this blade, then?"
9168,I thought you'd never ask.
9169,Where are you taking us?
9170,To Kelk.
9171,It was named after one of the greatest elders in the history of my people.
9172,He was known for his prowess in battle...
9173,...but I expect this Elderblade of which you speak also carried symbolic significance.
9174,So it's not just a fancy name?
9175,The blade of the elder! It all makes sense now!
9176,"This is Kelk, or what is left of it."
9177,Look sharp. We've got company!
9178,Armadillos! And so many of them!
9179,"Traveler, will you help us get rid of them?"
9180,Thanks. I appreciate it.
9181,Do not let them corner you!
9182,"Oh? Are you not going to fight as well, Rhal Ral?"
9183,He's more the “sit back and watch” sort.
9184,I believe the correct term is “offer moral support”!
9185,Have at you!
9186,"Be gone, scoundrel!"
9187,"Once I am properly dressed, I am unstoppable!"
9188,This is not going well! You must withdraw!
9189,We are being overwhelmed!
9190,Outdone by armadillos! I'll never live this down!
9191,That was the last of them.
9192,Thank goodness...
9193,Then let us uncover the Elderblade before any more turn up!
9194,"Hello, hello. This coffer looks promising."
9195,Open it! Open it!
9196,That was...remarkably straightforward.
9197,"What have we here, then?"
9198,Empty!? What a surprise!
9199,"And not a pleasant one, either."
9200,I had a feeling it was too good to be true.
9201,Sod this. Let's go home.
9202,Not yet! There is one more thing I would like to try!
9203,Nabaath mages enchanted swords to do their bidding...
9204,...and the Elderblade was probably full of...errr...magic!
9205,So if they used it to create an evil weapon...
9206,"Oh no... I'm not going to like this, am I?"
9207,Now that you mention it...
9208,...there have been sightings of an exceedingly large evil weapon not far from here.
9209,Yes! That must be it!
9210,What are the chances...
9211,Can you show us where it was last seen?
9212,Of course! Follow me!
9213,It should be around here...
9214,"Looks like it's not here. Oh well, never mind."
9215,Wait... Do you feel that?
9216,The Elderblade!
9217,It's even worse than I thought...
9218,Umm... Are you sure about this?
9219,Do not be afraid!
9220,Yes... Yes! Get me that blade!
9221,Th-This was never meant to happen...
9222,Flee the way you came! Even worse lies ahead...
9223,Where are they?
9224,Maybe someone<hex:02100103>saw them pass...
9225,Haaagh!
9226,Ahhh!
9227,Pathetic!
9228,Oi! Where are you going!?
9229,"I was scared! I thought it would kill you, then me!"
9230,This is most regrettable.
9231,Phew! I thought the damned thing would never give up!
9232,"The Elderblade is mine! I mean, ours!"
9233,I can scarcely believe we survived...
9234,I never doubted you for a moment! You all fought very well!
9235,"The sword of the great Kelk, enchanted by Nabaath magicks..."
9236,"Even now that the spell has been broken, the power within is undeniable."
9237,Which should see that it fetches a high price!
9238,"Rhal Ral, this blade must never fall into the wrong hands. We must ensure that it finds a worthy owner."
9239,Preferably one who does not mind parting with a few jinglies!
9240,What in the─
9241,That's <hex:021A020203>hardly<hex:021A020103> sporting...
9242,If you insist...
9243,"My thanks, mortal!"
9244,I tire of this farce!
9245,Dear me!
9246,"Are you quite<hex:02100103>all right, brother?"
9247,"You know, you're quite fun!<hex:02100103>As mortals go."
9248,Ohoho... What<hex:021A020203>ever<hex:021A020103> shall you do?
9249,"Not the least bit<hex:02100103>contrite, are you?"
9250,Why be contrite when<hex:02100103>you're so keen to fight?
9251,It's all starting to come back to me now.
9252,Let us see what we can find.
9253,By fire's kiss be cleansed!
9254,By wind's blades be flayed!
9255,"My magicks are unending, my loyalty undying!"
9256,Let's go!
9257,We have to find it!
9258,Could it be over there?
9259,Wait up!
9260,Oh no!
9261,I'm sorry...
9262,Don't worry about me.
9263,I believe in you!
9264,To rekindle our future!
9265,To restore our brethren!
9266,To revive our hope!
9267,To realize our salvation!
9268,To remake our star!
9269,To reclaim our world!
9270,I shall turn the very ground against you!
9271,Let the earth tremble!
9272,My flames shall raze your very soul!
9273,My ice shall chill the very essence of your being!
9274,Nothing shall remain!
9275,"The future is ours, and ours alone!"
9276,We will relinquish it to no one. No one!
9277,The most renowned swordsman of the Far East is about to descend upon the Gold Saucer!
9278,"His skills with a blade must be seen to be believed, but blink and you'll miss them, so keep those eyes peeled!"
9279,"Yojimbo, come on down!"
9280,Is that really him?
9281,This is the moment I've been waiting for!
9282,"I heard his blade is so sharp, he can split infinitives, whatever that means..."
9283,I blinked! Did I miss anything?
9284,"Behold, the sword art of legend─Zanmato!"
9285,Thank your lucky stars Zanmato thirsts not for your blood!
9286,"Go, Daigoro! Bring me those koban!"
9287,The rumors were true!
9288,My eyes can barely keep up!
9289,So that's the mighty Zanmato...
9290,I've never seen anything like it!
9291,"Fortune favors the bold, and if you are truly worthy, your luck will hold!"
9292,"Three cups I present! One contains riches, another my faithful hound! And the last...well, nothing at all!"
9293,"Uncover the coin, and it is yours. Chance upon Daigoro, and you will be sent running with your tail between your legs!"
9294,"Before I count to three, make your choice!"
9295,One...
9296,Two...
9297,Three!
9298,"Well, well! The kami smile upon you, brave one!"
9299,"If you are still game, so am I!"
9300,This is as far as you go!
9301,"Good boy, Daigoro!"
9302,The cup is quicker than the eye!
9303,"Now, choose!"
9304,Stop! Stop the pounding!
9305,We believe mochi mixed with waters from the Daitenzan's soulspring has stolen its way into our stores!
9306,From the soulspring...? Do you mean to tell me this mochi is alive!?
9307,"Damn it, Gozu has been spooked. Quickly, we must dispense with the mochi!"
9308,The living mochi must have come from last year's celebration. But how...?
9309,I fear our little game must soon come to an end. One last chance for Zanmato to shine!
9310,"Fleet of foot, and fortunate to boot! A well-deserved victory!"
9311,"Alas, it was not your lucky day, my friend. Though I must say, you certainly made me work hard for my coin!"
9312,Krow ot emit ti si?<hex:02100103>Swish-swish-aroo.

9319,"Yojimbo is currently discussing his fee, though I'm sure it won't take much longer."
9320,"It seems that we have reached an agreement with Yojimbo, who is due to appear any moment now."
9321,Sear the flesh from their bones!
9322,None can withstand the flames of Lugus!
9323,Burn them all!<hex:02100103>Hahahahahaha!
9324,To ashes with them!
9325,Aim. Aim.
9326,Fire. Fire.
9327,Bombs away.
9328,Kill. Kill.
9329,Kill. Kill. Kill.
9330,Would you look at that!
9331,It's like it goes on forever...
9332,This way.
9333,Intruders detected.
9334,Over here.
9335,Die. Die.
9336,Kill. Kill.
9337,Cut. Tear. Slaughter.
9338,<clank>
9339,<thunk>
9340,Ow. Ow.
9341,Target. Kill target.
9342,Intruders sighted.
9343,Stop. Stop.
9344,This is it...
9345,Kill... Kill...
9346,You die here.
9347,A dead end?
9348,I don't like the<hex:02100103>looks of that.
9349,Hmm... Yes...
9350,Ladies first!
9351,It's too quiet.
9352,How deep does this go?
9353,I've never seen the like...
9354,Intruders.<hex:02100103>Prepare yourselves.
9355,Help. Help. Someone...
9356,Emergency. Emergency.
9357,Mission...failed...
9358,<clank>

9360,Don't kill me... Don't kill me...
9361,Come on!
9362,Hurry!

9365,It's enormous!
9366,Does that count<hex:02100103>as a machine lifeform?
9367,Found the way up!
9368,You can go first.
9369,Acti...vating...unit...
9370,Fight. Protect.
9371,Fight. Destroy.
9372,Be careful. Careful.
9373,Grrroooaaaaaaaaahhh!!!
9374,Was...was that the mage we seek?
9375,I have a bad feeling about this.
9376,A rather ominous welcome...
9377,"Well, I'd say we're off to a fine start."
9378,Do those brooms not remind you of Master Matoya?
9379,Magicked brooms? Now where have I seen these before?
9380,Magicked brooms... How nostalgic.
9381,An...unexpected respite from battle.
9382,It's beautiful!
9383,It has to be a trap... It's always a trap.
9384,I sense a malign magic in the air.
9385,Her Grace's gardens. As beautiful as ever.
9386,"<gasp> Gh-Gh-Ghosts!?<hex:02100103>...No? Oh, thank the gods."
9387,I almost feel bad interrupting their meal.<hex:02100103>Even if they are only illusions.
9388,I can but wonder how lonely they must be.
9389,Their mastery of illusions is impressive.
9390,"Keep it together, Alphinaud. They're only illusions..."
9391,"Wonderful, more illusions. And now they're dancing this time."
9392,"An eerie yet beautiful sight, is it not?"
9393,It's as if we're glimpsing into the past.
9394,Please! We did not come to fight!
9395,"Well, so much for the diplomatic approach."
9396,On your guard!
9397,Oh dear. They don't yet seem inclined to talk.
9398,Wait! We only wish to talk!
9399,I knew this was a bad idea.
9400,"Not exactly a good first impression, but it will have to suffice."
9401,I doubt they will be quite so affable when next we meet.
9402,Is there no end to these creatures?
9403,Another chance to garner their interest.
9404,They certainly have a gift for creating familiars. If only there were not so many...
9405,I had hoped it was only a topiary. Alas...
9406,Mayhap now we have sown the seeds of interest.
9407,"Well, I'd rather not have to do that again..."
9408,I've had my fill of this garden. Let us move on.
9409,Perhaps now they see us as more than mere intruders.
9410,"By the gods, they've given life to flame!"
9411,Looks like they're finally taking us seriously.
9412,Have care. There's something peculiar about those flames.
9413,"I do believe we now have not only their curiosity, but their attention as well."
9414,Here I go!
9415,Whew... My thanks!
9416,"Ugh, my wings are drenched!"
9417,<sob> Please... I don't want to use this power anymore...
9418,<sob> I have no place in the world...
9419,By the kami!
9420,"Easy now, Gozu."
9421,Groooaaar!
9422,"There, there. Everything is fine, now."
9423,I see no further signs of wayward mochi about. Let us return to Limsa Lominsa for now.
9424,I fear this is too much for us. Fall back!
9425,Is there no end to this blasted mochi?
9426,Careful! No harm must come to Gozu!
9427,Be sure to stand clear of Gozu!
9428,Foolish bamboo! You dare to face my blade!?
9429,Let the bamboo fall where it may!
9430,Meow!♪
9431,Meow! Purrrrrr...♪

9433,"Well, I'd say we're off to a fine start."
9434,Perhaps. But how long our good fortune holds remains to be seen.
9435,How quaint. They remind me of Master Matoya's brooms.
9436,You and I remember those brooms─and their owner─quite differently.
9437,Oh dear. They don't yet seem inclined to talk.
9438,"Well, it was your idea to brandish blades at the door."
9439,I doubt they will be quite so affable when next we meet.
9440,"Another chance to pique their curiosity, then."
9441,Her Grace's gardens. As beautiful as ever.
9442,The path makes a curious pattern. Not unlike a magicked circle.
9443,Is there no end to these creatures?
9444,"If they think a few plants can slow us down, they're sorely mistaken."
9445,If we dried these leaves... Perhaps we could use them for tea!
9446,...Why are you like this?
9447,<gasp> Gh-Gh-Ghosts!?
9448,"Oh come now, Alphinaud. Don't be silly."
9449,"Ahhh! Alphinaud, behind you!"
9450,"Haha, very funny. I know they're not ghosts.<hex:02100103>...At least I hope they're not."
9451,"I do believe we now have not only their curiosity, but their attention as well."
9452,Then we had best not waste it.
9453,The chivalric spirit<hex:02100103>shall prevail this day!
9454,Taste mine axe!
9455,Know your folly!
9456,We must drive them out!
9457,Have at thee!
9458,I have you!
9459,Begone with you!
9460,This cannot be...
9461,For Lakeland!
9462,The elves shall prevail!
9463,And now you fall!
9464,"Excellent, the work's just about done! You've all earned a good rest!"
9465,Save for these weapons there's naught to be found here.
9466,Perhaps these will serve to refresh his memory.
9467,Stop!
9468,0
9469,Incoming! From the other side!
9470,"Right, we've got enough supplies! It's time to put 'em to use!"
9471,"To start with, we're buildin' facilities on the east side. Grab yourselves some material and hop to!"
9472,Here's where we lay the foundation for the new Firmament! Show me what you can do!
9473,We're stocked up on supplies again. Let's get back to it!
9474,We're pickin' up where we left off on the east side. Take what material you need and set to work!
9475,"If we keep our heads down, we'll finish it today. Neat and tidy does it!"
9476,"Aye, that's enough supplies, I reckon. Right, everyone, let's get to work!"
9477,This time we're buildin' facilities on the west side. Grab some material and put your backs into it!
9478,Show me what it means to have pride in your work!
9479,"Right, we've replenished the supplies we used up last time."
9480,We're continuin' our work on the west side. You know what to do!
9481,We're almost through with this task. Let's stay focused to the last!
9482,"Look alive, everyone! Today, we're lightin' up the court!"
9483,"Use the material to make firewood, then feed it to the braziers─it's simple as that."
9484,Let's stoke a roarin' fire to match our builders' spirit!
9485,"Right, our stores are lookin' good. It's time to add the finishin' touches!"
9486,Grab some material─we're refurbishin' the skybuilders' board and makin' a kitchen to boot!
9487,"Keep your hearts in it, everyone! We're just about done with the court!"
9488,"What in the Fury's name? After all this time, this is all we've managed? <sigh> We're going to have to start over..."
9489,I sense a potent power!
9490,Just leave it to me!
9491,All right!
9492,"Uhhh, how it churns..."
9493,Yah!
9494,Here I go!
9495,Get ready!
9496,Show your ugly face!
9497,<sob> I can't control my power...
9498,Stay away from me! Stay away!
9499,Get out... Get out of my head...
9500,<sob> <sniffle>
9501,Help me... Somebody...
9502,Yeowch! I-I don't want to become porxelain!
9503,Eeek!

9522,"What surprise is in store for us next, I wonder."
9523,I trust you'll make the right choice this time.
9524,I will defer to your judgment.
9525,The choice is clear.
9526,"Whatever comes out, we can handle it."
9527,I tire of this guardian's <hex:021A020203>games<hex:021A020103>.

9610,"Would that I had brought my own rod... Perhaps if I...<hex:02100103>Ah, what am I thinkin'? I've captainly duties to attend to!"
9611,"The stronger the bite, the bigger the fish!"
9612,"Fish might look simple, but some can be mighty particular when it comes to their bait."
9613,Fish! Fish with every scantling of your being!
9614,"Fish twice as hard, for my sake!"
9615,"Hah hah, the feast is here!"
9616,"If you can't land a catch now, I'll have to ask you to turn in your rod!"
9617,Distraction's a fisher's worst enemy! Focus on your rod! Focus!

9620,"When the sun sets, the sea comes alive."
9621,"Once, one of my crew dropped a lantern overboard. The waters started glittering as if to thank us!"
9622,Rumor has it that during rough weather is when the spectral megalodon sets out on its hunt.
9623,Pray you don't disturb the spectral megalodon. I've heard stories of it swallowin' whole crews in one gulp.
9624,
9625,
9626,"In the dead of night, I swear I've seen the coral itself movin' about like some kind of worm."
9627,"There ain't a shrimp to be found in these waters. What's eatin' them, you think?"
9628,"The spectral discus is a sight to see, but it'll startle at the smallest sound."
9629,"Watch out for the spectral discus─it ain't tiny, so I reckon it'll be hard to miss!"
9630,
9631,
9632,What? Are those...mouse bones? What in the seven hells happened here?
9633,"If you're in the mood for a fright, try fishin' here in the dark. You won't regret it─or maybe you will!"
9634,"This heat's rough, but if you can bear the sun beatin' down on you, you'll have your pick of the fish."
9635,"The fish here are huge, and slow as they come! Shouldn't be hard to land a catch."
9636,
9637,
9638,Last time we made land someone told me of a fish that swims with the risin' sun.
9639,I've seen some fishers have luck with a longer cast.
9640,"The fish here might be small, but they're as fierce as any in the sea!"
9641,"When the wind howls and the thunder claps, the prize catches come out to swim."
9642,"They say when thunder rolls across the sky, it whips certain fish into a frenzy. So they say, anyway."
9643,"If you're lookin' to bait the spectral current, you'll want to cast for the little fish, I reckon."
9644,"Local legend has it that when night falls, a horror rises from the depths to drag down unwary vessels..."
9645,"What's been eatin' the squid, then? This spot used to be swarmin' with 'em."
9646,"Bloody hells, it's comin' down in buckets. This'll rile up the schools..."
9647,Bait your hook for fish of middling size. You'll thank me later.
9648,Saw an unlikely creature in the water earlier this morning─thought I might still be dreamin'.
9649,Little insects are the ticket to some extraordinary catches. Trust me.
9650,"Ugh, it's like sailin' through a damn waterfall. Just the kind of weather <hex:021A020203>they<hex:021A020103> like to hunt in..."
9651,"Careful, now. There's some big, mean buggers that swim in these parts, and they ain't shy about comin' up for a bite!"
9652,"Sometimes after dusk, you hear it echo across the water...a grindin', crackin', crunchin' kind of sound."
9653,I hear the beaches hereabouts are strewn with bits of shattered shells.
9654,Some fish love swimmin' about in a thunderstorm. It's like they're just darin' a bolt to strike!
9655,"No one knows why, but big catches and spectral currents often go hand in hand. What's the ocean tellin' us, I wonder?"
9656,"Around here the risin' sun brings big fish, lookin' for a meal. Wouldn't want to miss breakfast."
9657,A master fisher once told me that he owed his success to the sack of fresh mackerel he always kept close at hand. 
9658,"I can barely tell the sea from the rain! Those little buggers love swimmin' in a downpour, though..."
9659,"Stands to reason that to catch a small fish, you need even smaller bait!"
9660,I've heard whispers that a pair of Ruby Dragons prowl these waters at night. Always wanted to see 'em with my own eyes.
9661,"Glass dragons aren't known to suffer competition. If you want to draw one out, make it think a rival's encroachin' on their territory."
9662,"Storm like this, I'd bet a sack o' gil that a certain fish is on the prowl..."
9663,"Keep your wits about you in these waters. The fish might not look it, but they can pull that rod right out of your hands!"
9664,"Sailors say that when night falls, you can see a volcano come to life on the ocean floor, like a single red eye openin' in the darkness."
9665,"Squid are a common sight around here, as are the things that come to hunt 'em."
9666,Sometimes you have to get soakin' wet to have a chance at catchin' the best fish.
9667,Brace yourselves against something sturdy. The big bastards in these waters like to give passin' boats a love tap from time to time.
9668,Sailors passin' through these parts have told stories of an undersea flower bed in full bloom.
9669,"The plum trees are a sight to behold─if you can ignore the bugs swarmin' around them, that is."

9714,<pant> I've had enough...
9715,Am I in the right place for the procession?
9716,The eggs are ready. Let the festivities begin!
9717,Heh. Today's smilin' children are tomorrow's loyal customers.
9718,Can I take this godsdamned rabbit's pate off? It's godsdamned swelterin' in here!
9719,It seems the gang's all here!
9720,"Are you ready, my friends? The parade is about to begin!"
9721,"We make for the Lancers' Guild! Come one, come all!"
9722,And we're off!
9723,Spriggans!? Why does it always have to be spriggans...
9724,"Show some spirit! It's Hatching–tide, after all!"
9725,Anythin' to drum up business...
9726,What does a bloke have to do to get a bleedin' drink around here!?
9727,Don't forget the children! Share the gift of Hatching–tide with one and all!
9728,Over here! No child must go home empty-handed!
9729,Our work here is done! Time to move on!
9730,Prepare the presents! The children await!
9731,"I'm a weaponsmith, not a bleedin' wet nurse!"
9732,Spriggy spriggy! Eggs so pretty!
9733,"Spriggy say less talky, more givy!"
9734,Seven hells! What in the─!?
9735,"Alright, already! Just get your bloody paws off me!"
9736,I could swear I've heard that voice somewhere...
9737,"No, it couldn't be..."
9738,Mister Rabbit! Missus Rabbit! Do you have an egg for me!?
9739,"And me! I want an egg, too!"
9740,No dilly-dallying! We must move on!
9741,The Lancers' Guild is up ahead. Just a bit further now!
9742,The procession is almost at an end. How many children smiled because of you today?
9743,We must drive them out!
9744,There's only one thing these savages are good for...
9745,Just getting started!
9746,That I should lose again...
9747,This marks the end of the procession!
9748,"Be proud, my friends, for you have made many a child happy this day!"
9749,"Should you be willing to join us again, we welcome your participation."
9750,"Till next time, a happy Hatching–tide to one and all!"
9751,"All right, people, it's time for our first concerted works in a while!"
9752,"We're buildin' the Mattock, and to begin with, we need to clear away the debris!"
9753,"It's the first of many steps to come, so let's see this off to a good start!"
9754,We've got the supplies we need. Now it's time to get to work!
9755,It's the same task as before─clearing away debris in preparation for the road!
9756,Let's see to it nothin' lies in the way of the reconstruction effort!
9757,"To your places, everyone. It's time to get to work!"
9758,"Today, we're clearing away the last little bits of debris on the Mattock."
9759,"How good a job we do will tell on the next works, so let's make it squeaky clean!"
9760,"Our stores are in good order, which means it's time for more concerted works!"
9761,"Grab the supplies you need, and let's pave the way─literally and figuratively!"
9762,"The end's in sight, so give it everything you've got!"
9763,All right! It's time for the next round of concerted works! 
9764,We're gettin' started on the fountain. Grab the supplies you need and put 'em to use!
9765,"This will be a place of rest and relaxation for residents, so let's not spare any effort!"
9766,"I hope you're all ready to work, because today we're makin' that fountain flow!"
9767,"Everything you need, you can get from the supply pile!"
9768,Let's make it into a beautiful place the residents can be proud of!
9769,"All right, everyone. From today, we're commencin' works on Saint Roelle's Dais!"
9770,First things first: we need scaffolds. Grab yourselves some supplies and get to it!
9771,"We're layin' the groundwork for what's to come, so let's make it as sturdy as can be!"
9772,"Right then, it's time to get busy on Saint Roelle's Dais!"
9773,"The area's a mess of debris, so that's what we're gonna work on today."
9774,Let's put our backs into it and clear ourselves a path!
9775,"Get ready, everyone! It's time for another round of concerted works!"
9776,We're clearin' away the last bits of debris scattered across Saint Roelle's Dais.
9777,"Might be as it's a humble task, but let's do a tidy job of it!"
9778,We've reached our target for supplies. Time to get to work again!
9779,"Grab what you need from the supply pile, and we'll start fixin' up Saint Roelle's Dais!"
9780,"Speed's of the essence for this task, so let's keep those hands movin'!"
9781,"Right, it's time to make Saint Roelle's Dais true to its name!"
9782,"Help yourselves to the supplies, and let's see the stage finished!"
9783,"Show me the best of your workmanship, now!"
9784,"All right, everyone, we're finally gettin' started on the New Nest proper!"
9785,First order of business is clearin' the debris in the area by the Mendicant's Court!
9786,"The more hands we have, the quicker we'll be done!"
9787,"Roll up your sleeves, 'cause concerted works are startin'!"
9788,"Today, we're clearin' away more debris ahead of construction on the New Nest!"
9789,Let's stay focused and get it done with the least fuss!
9790,"Right, the appointed hour's here. Let's get to work!"
9791,"There's still debris in the New Nest that wants for clearin', so that's our task for today."
9792,"Once we're done, that'll be it for the large chunks!"
9793,"Right, let's get these works underway!"
9794,This time we're clearin' away the fine debris still scattered about the New Nest.
9795,"There's a lot of ground to cover, so we'll want to split into smaller crews!"
9796,"All right, everyone, it's time for more concerted works!"
9797,"After all that clearin' we did for the New Nest, we're finally startin' on the actual buildin'."
9798,"Grab the supplies you need, and we'll fix up all the streets and steps!"
9799,"Startin' from today, we're gonna be buildin' houses!"
9800,"This hardly needs sayin', but this is what we've been workin' towards!"
9801,"So go and grab some supplies, and let's show our builders' spirit!"
9802,"To your places, everyone! We're commencin' concerted works!"
9803,"Today, we're completin' the first set of houses! You know where the supplies are!"
9804,"The work we do here will set the tone for the rest, so let your skills shine!"
9805,Our stores are in good shape. It's time to get back to it!
9806,"We're startin' on more houses today, and we'll keep buildin' them till we've filled up the New Nest."
9807,Take what supplies you need and put 'em to good use!
9808,"We've replenished our supplies, so it's time for more works!"
9809,The goal today's to complete another set of houses.
9810,Let's build 'em as if you're buildin' your own home!
9811,"Right, everyone, it's time to commence the next works!"
9812,"This time it's the final site for the New Nest, and the last set of houses!"
9813,"By now it goes without sayin', but the job calls for precision, so let's keep it nice and tidy!"
9814,"This is it, everyone! The very last works for the New Nest!"
9815,"Today, we're completin' not only the last of the houses, but the entire area as well!"
9816,Let's give it absolutely everything we've got and finish on a high note!
9817,"Deft of paw, with kin do I vie."
9818,Betterment of the whole do our efforts descry.
9819,"With fearsome fang, I travel with pack."
9820,For peace our land shall never lack.
9821,On my belly do I crawl.
9822,"By my strength, prosperity reigns in our hall."
9823,We must choose carefully.
9824,Perhaps a hint is carved in the stone...
9825,Hmmm...
9826,Would that I could read these talismans.
9827,<sigh> I can make no sense of this riddle.
9828,Is there perhaps some meaning to their arrangement?
9829,Strange... All of these talismans appear blank to my eye.
9830,On your guard!
9831,Finally.
9832,Ah! What is that!?
9833,Let us be brief.
9834,What is this meant to be?
9835,Are these even animals?
9836,Crawls on its belly...?
9837,Cymet! No!
9838,We have to get them back... We have to!
9839,Almet will be fine... She has to be...
9840,Bugger me... I'm bloody beat...
9841,"Heh... Not as easy as hammerin' dents in kettles, ain't it?"
9842,R-Rowena!? What in the seventh hell─!?
9843,Shush now. I've got a reputation to uphold.
9844,Heh... Wouldn't have figured you the type for dressin' up like a rabbit.
9845,"Shut yer gob, Rowena! Ye look as bleedin' ridiculous as I do!"
9846,Anythin' for business...
9847,"After all, today's children are tomorrow's customers, I always say..."
9848,Ye greedy-arsed wench...
9849,"A happy Hatching–tide to you, my young friend!"
9850,<hex:021A020203>You<hex:021A020103> get an egg! And <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> get an egg!
9851,Remember to shop at the House o' Splendors!
9852,We're always lookin' for good help!
9853,"Here's yer bleedin' egg, ye whiny brat!"
9854,Take yer present an' stop yer bloody cryin' already!
9855,Look! It's a talking rabbit!
9856,"Do you have an egg for me, <hex:020813E905FF07>Missus<hex:FF07>Mister<hex:03> Rabbit!?"
9857,"Oh, thank you!"
9858,It's the best Hatching–tide ever!
9859,Spriggy eggy! Eggy spriggy!
9860,Spriggy givy! Spriggy taky!
9861,I see...
9862,I see we're not to have a peaceful journey.
9863,We're getting close.
9864,Mayhaps 'twas Bismarck with whom I ought have bargained...
9865,Mayhaps 'twas Bismarck with whom I ought have bargained...
9866,For heavens' sake...
9867,This lot are nothing compared to the barnacles.
9868,Such ease of motion despite his size─it's truly a wonder.
9869,Look! A trench!
9870,Such ease of motion despite his size─it's truly a wonder.
9871,I'm certainly glad for Bismarck's preparation now.
9872,Oof!
9873,What a landing!
9874,The force of it...'twas nigh overwhelming.
9875,The force of it...'twas nigh overwhelming.
9876,"Just...stay on your feet this time, please."
9877,Incredible!
9878,"Come along. Disturbing secrets await, and all that."
9879,"Our deepest gratitude, great one."
9880,"Our deepest gratitude, great one."
9881,"Thank you, Bismarck!"
9882,What <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> that?
9883,"We are fated to happen upon strange abominations, apparently."
9884,What in the world...?
9885,"We are fated to happen upon strange abominations, apparently."
9886,Never have I seen the like.
9887,<hex:021A020203>And<hex:021A020103> it stinks. Lovely.
9888,Might similar creatures dwell beneath the seas of the Source?
9889,Do... Do you think there are more of them?
9890,"Some manner of harrowing, perhaps...?"
9891,Might similar creatures dwell beneath the seas of the Source?
9892,Look at this architecture...
9893,The similarities to Amaurot are undeniable.
9894,'Tis unmistakably of the ancients' design.
9895,Look at this architecture...
9896,This is precisely what we were looking for.
9897,What are they doing with that crystal?
9898,"Whatever they're doing, I doubt it's good for us."
9899,In channeling aether through the crystal... Hmm.
9900,In channeling aether through the crystal... Hmm.
9901,I think we have passed the point of theory!
9902,This is a reconstructed “concept” then?
9903,Looks like the benthos have learned to use this place.
9904,"An impressive concept, to be certain."
9905,"An impressive concept, to be certain."
9906,"We might learn much, if more such crystals are to be found within."
9907,There are so many...
9908,"Why, this... This could take a lifetime to study..."
9909,It's beautiful!
9910,"Why, this... This could take a lifetime to study..."
9911,There may be still more out of sight.
9912,"Though I mislike this, we may as well have done with it."
9913,She plans to fight us herself? How efficient.
9914,Yonder queen standeth as more than symbol to her soldiers. Have caution.
9915,"Though I mislike this, we may as well have done with it."
9916,"If she wants a fight, I'm happy to oblige!"
9917,
9918,
9919,
9920,
9921,
9922,
9923,For the sake of our world!
9924,In the name of the Light!
9925,To the ashes whence you came!
9926,Death rain upon you!
9927,I'll cut 'em down to size!
9928,"Lend me your strength, my servants!"
9929,"Cleansing water, wash away evil!"
9930,Haaah!
9931,I will destroy you!
9932,Feel the pain!
9933,There they are! Resting right out in the open!
9934,Just as our scouts reported. We'll hit them hard and fast!
9935,Like an eagle amongst the hares!
9936,For Bozja!
9937,Wh─ It's an ambush!
9938,The bastards grow too bold by half...
9939,Well? What are you waiting for? Crush them!
9940,What's this I see? The pride of the Empire hard-pressed by Resistance rabble?
9941,"Bah, this brutish squabble has gone on long enough."
9942,"If you are so eager to feel the flames of war, then I shall be happy to oblige!"
9943,"Hmph, you are more stalwart than I gave you credit for."
9944,"A poor showing from my own troops, but nevertheless...they served well enough to keep you distracted."
9945,"We will meet again, I think. In fact, I shall make certain of it."
9946,A few more staves and we'd have had them... Retreat!
9947,We'll never live this down...
9948,Damn them!
9949,Let the cowards flee. We need to lick our own wounds.
9950,"Even so, I'll count this one a victory!"
9951,That mage... What a nightmare.
9952,We wouldn't have held out much longer.
9953,Let's just be glad we survived...
9954,"Hmph. The briefest lick of fire, and they burn to cinders."
9955,"Why, this “Resistance” may as well be a stack of kindling!"
9956,"Withdraw at your leisure, men. The enemy is beaten."
9957,"Right, pack it up, lads! We return the victors this day!"
9958,Haha! Glory to the IVth!
9959,In Gabranth's name!
9960,The imperials have us outmatched... Fall back!
9961,We'll never win like this...
9962,But...we had the upper hand!
9963,They have us surrounded!
9964,...We're done for.
9965,Walked right into it...
9966,Weapons at the ready! We fight our way free!
9967,R-Right! We'll show these bastards!
9968,Victory or death!
9969,There will be no escape!
9970,There will be no survivors!
9971,Show them no mercy!
9972,Charge!
9973,<sigh> Once again I find our soldiers succumbing to an inferior force.
9974,"...Ah, but of course. I must stand before the vaunted “hero of the Resistance.”"
9975,"Fear not, Albeleo.<hex:02100103>I, Sartauvoir quo Soranus, will reduce this nuisance to ash."
9976,"Hah! Though I grow old and grey, ever does the thrill of battle stoke the embers of my soul! "
9977,Yes... The inferno builds to an all-consuming finale! Embrace the spectacle or perish!
9978,Glorious! Simply glorious! You see how one must heed the words of one's elders?
9979,"...Even as a soldier must heed the commands of his general. I leave you now, but know that this contest will have its conclusion!"
9980,A pity. I had hoped for a more worthy contest.
9981,"Still, a soldier must fight as his general commands. We have not the luxury of choosing our opponents..."
9982,"We're following, obviously."
9983,More pods...
9984,My kingdom for a proper bridge.
9985,Odds on not having to fight that giant thing...?
9986,"Considering that's one of the androids that attacked us, low."
9987,Hurry!
9988,Careful!
9989,This is odd...er than usual.
9990,Did you see that blast radius!?
9991,Three androids this time...
9992,But still no 2P.
9993,Excellent work on not dying!
9994,This must be the way.
9995,More falling!?
9996,Whee!
9997,Eurgh...
9998,Look at all of this technology!
9999,What <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> this place?
10000,Now this definitely seems like a trap.
10001,Down we go...
10002,But how far down?
10003,Is it just me...or does this seem...different?
10004,"Dangerous, certainly."
10005,Aaand there are more.
10006,If you could clear the path...?
10007,Broken machines...
10008,2B must have gotten here first.
10009,We made it...
10010,Am I dead? I don't feel dead.
10011,<huff> <pant>
10012,"My thanks, you saved our skins out there.<hex:02100103>We're headed home, lads─quick march!"
10013,Haha! Found them! Their scouting days are well and truly over!
10014,Blaz! Velibor! It's our time to shine!
10015,Indeed.
10016,0
10017,None shall escape my blade.
10018,"Come, Ghun Gun! Our friends need help!"
10019,"Be careful, yes?"
10020,Come and visit us again!
10021,"I haven't the faintest what's going on, but you'd best keep moving!"
10022,There is nowhere to run!
10023,Just when I think there's a commotion...
10024,Lucky we chanced to be testing some Talos!
10025,"Take care, you hear?"
10026,"Well, it's back to the workshop with this lot..."
10027,"Why do they glow like that? Weird, I tell you!"
10028,"These are the ones we should play with, right?"
10029,0
10030,"We Nu Mou are not wont to fight, but we know when we must!"
10031,"Whatever's going on, you've got my hammer!"
10032,Just another job for a bounty hunter.
10033,0
10034,I've had far worse than this lot.
10035,Not sin eaters by the look of them.
10036,"Whatever they are, they're not to be trifled with."
10037,"Keep it steady, eh, catboy? Don't want no arrow in my arse by accident."
10038,Wha─!? Do you take me for a craven!?
10039,"Ugh, I would <hex:021A020203>kill<hex:021A020103> for a drink right now..."
10040,"When this is over, I'll buy you as many as you want!"
10041,"Oho, does that offer extend to me as well?"
10042,Save the talk for the tavern! We're not out of the woods yet!
10043,"Ack, no bloody end in sight..."
10044,Press on! We'll hold them here!
10045,Victory is ours!
10046,Empty metal shells. Barely worth my time.
10047,I find little satisfaction in such feeble prey.
10048,"My blade is blunted, withdrawal the only available course of action."
10049,"It's no good, boys. We'd best call it a day."
10050,What a disgrace!

10061,No! I won't let you have him!

10066,Kweeeh!
10067,"Kweh, kweh!"
10068,That's the spirit!
10069,Tear them apart!
10070,This fight's as good as won!
10071,Now strike!
10072,Go back to whatever hole you crawled out from!
10073,You haven't beaten us yet!
10074,I will watch you burn!
10075,"Glllgh... Burn, burn, burn!"
10076,My magick is infallible!
10077,More power! More power!
10078,Bear witness to my might!
10079,Time to end this.
10080,"Flame, take flight!"
10081,You shan't be so lucky a second time!
10082,"Will you burn, or will you melt?"
10083,Hahahaha! Now do you see?
10084,"I have enjoyed our time together,<hex:02100103>but all things must come to an end."
10085,I am just getting started!
10086,"Though it galls me to use such underhanded tactics,<hex:02100103>for you, poison will suffice."
10087,I am the inferno!
10088,Ashes to ashes!
10089,The light of my flame grows dim...
10090,"Ha...ha... No, not yet..."
10091,Grrruuunnnh...
10092,Raaawrrrh!
10093,As if we don't have enough to contend with...
10094,May the fallen find peace.
10095,"Well, it made for a change of pace, if nothing else!"
10096,Let us begin.
10097,Is that all?
10098,I'll rend you to pieces!
10099,Might want to watch your step!
10100,Can you withstand this!?
10101,For the future of Bozja!
10102,"Today, we take back our homeland!"
10103,For freedom!
10104,Death to the oppressors!
10105,Keep going!
10106,Follow the Blade!
10107,You can't keep a good Bozjan down!
10108,One step closer to freedom!
10109,We'll never surrender!
10110,You imperials'll have to try harder than that!
10111,This isn't getting us anywhere. Retreat!
10112,We've been outmatched...
10113,No choice left but to withdraw!
10114,They've gotten the better of us!
10115,Am I no better than a novice?
10116,"Even with this blade, I have been found wanting."
10117,Looks like I've gotten carried away.
10118,No! I'll not die in a place like this!
10119,"I've still got some fight left in me...<hex:02100103>Not much, though."
10120,You'll have to fight the good fight without me...
10121,Ha! Fat lot of good those fancy weapons did you!
10122,"For the glory of...uh...<hex:02100103>How does it go, again?"
10123,"Anyway, I'll kill you to death!"
10124,Fresh meat!
10125,I will grind your bones!
10126,Time to spill some Bozjan blood!
10127,Stay still and let me kill you!
10128,No! Not the garula!
10129,You're no match for the mighty Daguza!
10130,"Ow! That hurts, you know!"
10131,Must flee!
10132,Run away! Run away!
10133,Ungh... My limbs...
10134,Bwahaha! Is that the best you can muster?
10135,Too weak!
10136,Finished so soon?
10137,They got anything worth pinching?
10138,For Bozja!
10139,"Battlefield or no, this is our land and we must defend it!"
10140,With me!
10141,"Excellent work, Blade <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0303>!"
10142,They're more resilient than they look. Fall back!
10143,It seems I've lost the upper hand...
10144,All my hate...I bring to bear!
10145,◎￥▲×□％♪
10146,"My, my. What a pathetic display!"
10147,I'll leave these sorry wretches to you. Have fun!
10148,"I, in the meantime, shall be spending time with my newest pet."
10149,I...I've never seen anything like this before!
10150,"Nevertheless, they'll fall like all the rest!"
10151,It looks like we've cowed them for now.
10152,"The injured have made their escape, and I suggest we do likewise."
10153,How I have waited for this moment!
10154,The castrum is all but ours!
10155,We shall lead the way to victory!
10156,Attack!
10157,The end is in sight!
10158,I knew we could do it!
10159,Let's press on!
10160,Surrender now and no one gets hurt!
10161,Follow my lead!
10162,See what your villainy has wrought!
10163,Behind me!
10164,Stand aside! I have no interest in the likes of you!
10165,"Sing, my blade!"
10166,Our work is far from over.
10167,Their leaders yet elude us.
10168,Your movements betray you.
10169,We'll smash right through them!
10170,I've had training dummies that put up more of a fight!
10171,Haha! Who's next?
10172,Just another notch on my hilt!
10173,Now's our chance at glory!
10174,This is easier than I thought!
10175,"Blaz, Velibor!<hex:02100103>We've got them on the run!"
10176,Take...this!
10177,Hah!
10178,Yah!
10179,"Damn you, rebels!"
10180,That's far enough!
10181,Press the advantage!
10182,Imperial dog!
10183,Give them no quarter!
10184,You think you can beat us on our own turf!?
10185,By fang and claw shall they be rent!
10186,May my foe be trampled underfoot!
10187,My hubris has become my undoing...
10188,Cut them down!
10189,I want that one's head on a pike!
10190,Hold the line!
10191,I don't like the look of that.<hex:02100103>I get the feeling it's not the usual imperial magitek...
10192,MUST SWEEP...MUST CLEAN...<hex:02100103>...BZZZT...<hex:02100103>MUST...MUST...KILL...
10193,"Keep your wits about you, everyone!"
10194,Prepare yourselves!
10195,Imperials! How did they get so close!?
10196,Let that be a lesson to you!
10197,The day is ours!
10198,"So they would weave their magicks in service of the Empire?<hex:02100103>Conscripts or no, they must be dealt with."
10199,Forward!
10200,"If we're to earn our freedom, we can't let the Bozjans get the better of us!"
10201,"Remember, we're only here for reconnaissance.<hex:02100103>If things take a turn for the worse, you are to retreat immediately."
10202,"Understood, Dyunbu!"
10203,Those still bearing injuries must fall back.
10204,But I can still fight!
10205,"We won't abandon you, Dyunbu!"
10206,"Please, you must retreat!"
10207,Leave this lot to us!
10208,"You're in no fit state to continue. Fall back, I say!"
10209,How can we hope to build Gabranth's new nation...<hex:02100103>if this is all we're capable of?
10210,We can't withstand this attack any longer!
10211,You never stood a chance against Gunnhildr's Blades!
10212,Haha! And don't come back!
10213,"How can they counteract my magicks so easily?<hex:02100103>I must retreat, find another way!"
10214,But Xeven is invincible!
10215,It's no good!
10216,"Why will you Bozjans not listen to reason?<hex:02100103>Place your faith in Gabranth, as we have!"
10217,Death to the Resistance!
10218,I'm gonna make you bleed!
10219,Surrender or die!
10220,"Resistance is futile! Haha, get it? Because they're the... Never mind."
10221,Know the depths of your folly!
10222,For the IVth Legion!
10223,You'll give up for good if you've got any sense!
10224,For great justice.
10225,"When you arrive in the seven hells, tell 'em the IVth Legion sent you!"
10226,Another fine victory!<hex:02100103>Let's head back and celebrate.
10227,Why won't they just die!?
10228,Fall back!
10229,How could we lose to this filth?
10230,Better to run than to die!
10231,Target confirmed.
10232,Sufficient armaments remaining.<hex:02100103>Continuing with attack.
10233,Ceruleum consumption within acceptable limits.
10234,Target within line of sight.<hex:02100103>Opening fire.
10235,"Arise, and devour!"
10236,Cast thy shadow!
10237,Hah!
10238,"Before my blade, you are nothing."
10239,A futile endeavor.
10240,You've never seen a blade like <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>!
10241,It's too late for you!
10242,Hyah!
10243,This one's mine!
10244,My beasts will be the death of you!
10245,Time to repay Lyon's trust!
10246,Lyon has taught me well!
10247,Away with you!
10248,I've no time to deal with you vermin!
10249,See how they run!
10250,We'll beat some sense into you!
10251,Don't blame me if you end up dead!
10252,"The IVth Legion don't take no prisoners!<hex:02100103>Well, except when we do..."
10253,You'll run if you know what's good for you!
10254,Better to flee while you still can!
10255,Hasn't there been enough bloodshed?
10256,Can't you see? Our ideals are the same!
10257,"If you won't listen to reason, you leave me with no choice!"
10258,Now you've gone too far!
10259,"Strike hard and swift, as the eagle!"
10260,"By Gunnhildr's Blades, we shall be victorious!"
10261,This is how we Bozjans do battle!
10262,For a better tomorrow!
10263,Freedom for Bozja! Freedom for all!
10264,Stick with me! I'll keep you from harm.
10265,Pathetic!
10266,Not worth my time!
10267,Your life is mine for the taking!
10268,Fear not. Your death will be swift!
10269,Let's take it one imperial at a time.
10270,"Watch my back, would you?"
10271,By our powers combined!
10272,Now for something special!
10273,"Today is a good day to die! For you, that is!"
10274,Out of the way!
10275,Enough of these lackeys! I want their leader!
10276,"Take a good look, imperials. You'll only get to see this once!"
10277,"Much as it galls me, we've no choice but to retreat!"
10278,"Oh, the ignominy!"
10279,REQUESTING REINFORCEMENTS.
10280,Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse!
10281,SYSTEM DAMAGE: 95%.<hex:02100103>ENTERING SAFE MODE...<hex:02100103>SYSTEMS OFFLINE...
10282,I should have spent more time on its restoration.<hex:02100103>No matter. The data I have gleaned will prove most useful.
10283,I just heard a voice!<hex:02100103>And not a particularly pleasant one...
10284,"Even in its incomplete state, it was extremely effective.<hex:02100103>I look forward to unearthing more of its kind in the clockwork city..."
10285,I take full responsibility for this abject failure!
10286,"Oh, dear..."
10287,Not today!
10288,Naught to worry about.
10289,I have slept long enough!
10290,I'm in your debt.
10291,"Once more, then!"
10292,Allow me!
10293,If I may!
10294,There!
10295,Hold still!
10296,Something special for you!
10297,Stubborn!
10298,Are you all right?
10299,I'll tend your wounds.
10300,Hold on!
10301,"Right, then..."
10302,Show me what you can do!
10303,Just the beginning!
10304,My shield will not buckle!
10305,In one fell swoop!
10306,Our tale will not end here!
10307,"Remember, these are not unthinking machines, they are soldiers, which makes them all the more dangerous."
10308,Still holding up?
10309,Forward!
10310,This is as far as you go!
10311,Not another step closer!
10312,I have you now!
10313,You're finished!
10314,Take this!
10315,"Roar, Nidhogg! Roar!"
10316,Significant damage sustained.<hex:02100103>Adjusting battle parameters.
10317,Hyaaah!
10318,"That's it! Well fought, everyone!"
10319,Uwaaah!
10320,"All of you, fall back!<hex:02100103>We'll have to rethink our strategy."
10321,Chase and char!
10322,Dance and wither!
10323,Burst and burn!
10324,Hunt and scorch!
10325,Strike and sear!
10326,Our freedom awaits!
10327,We've come too far to lose it all now!
10328,My shield...is impregnable...
10329,Damn! We must find a way past his defense!
10330,My arrows don't do a thing!
10331,Uhhh...
10332,Graaargh...
10333,Unnnghhh...
10334,Ahhh...
10335,Resistance troops approaching!
10336,And not a moment too soon. The time has come to prove my worth to Lyon!
10337,Grrrrrr...
10338,"Many thanks for the materials! With this, the construction can begin in earnest!"
10339,"First things first, we'll need to clear our path of debris before we can get to buildin'."
10340,"For the future of Ishgard, let's give it our all!"
10341,Your efforts on our behalf are most appreciated. We need all the hands we can get!
10342,"Featherfall's a mess of debris at the moment, and it's our job to do somethin' about that."
10343,"Remember, we're not just pushing rocks around. We're forgin' a path to a new day in Ishgard!"
10344,We're all stocked up on materials! Time to commence concerted works!
10345,"There's still debris in Featherfall that wants for clearin', and that's where you come in."
10346,Many thanks! We'd be lost without artisans like you.
10347,"To your places, everyone! It's time to get to work!"
10348,"Today, we're goin' to make the streets of Featherfall positively shine!"
10349,Any last specks of debris are to be cleared away!
10350,"Look alive, everyone! We're movin' on to the next phase of concerted works!"
10351,"Grab the supplies you need, and let's pave the way forward in Featherfall!"
10352,These streets will be home to the Firmament's new center of commerce! I don't want to see a single stone out of place!
10353,"Startin' from today, we're gonna be puttin' up buildings!"
10354,You'll find everythin' you need in the supply piles. Now let's get to work!
10355,"One day, this place will house a branch of the Skysteel Manufactory, and a residence hall to boot!"
10356,"Today, we'll be finishin' work on the manufactory branch and residence hall!"
10357,"This is what we've been buildin' up towards, so let's give it all we've got!"
10358,Let's build something that will stand as a monument to our craftsmanship!
10359,"Look sharp, all of you! It's time to begin concerted works!"
10360,"House-buildin' is the order of the day, so grab some materials and get to work!"
10361,No rest until the streets of Featherfall are lined with stately residences!
10362,"Thanks to you, we've all the materials we need, and then some! Time to commence concerted works!"
10363,Today we're puttin' the finishing touches on these houses. You know where to find the supplies you need!
10364,"Show us your skill, and build houses any adventurer'd be happy to call home!"
10365,It's that time again─time to begin concerted works!
10366,Today we'll be workin' on still more houses! You know where to find the supplies you need!
10367,"This'll be Featherfall's last set of houses, so let's make 'em our finest yet!"
10368,"This is it, everyone─the final stage of construction here in Featherfall! No restin' till the job is done!"
10369,Just a bit more work and these houses will be ready for livin' in. You know what needs to be done!
10370,This is the last set of houses. I want to see your best work yet!
10371,"In today's concerted works, we'll be cleanin' up the Abacus!"
10372,That means clearin' away any debris that's blockin' our way!
10373,"It's not a pretty job, but just think of the magnificent market that'll be standin' here someday!"
10374,Time to get to work again! We need all the hands we can get!
10375,"Today, we're clearin' away the last little bits of debris that still clutter the Abacus!"
10376,"The more thorough we are today, the more work we'll save ourselves in the next stage─so no slackin'!"
10377,"Thanks to our artisans, we're fully stocked with supplies. Now let's get to work!"
10378,It's time to pave the Abacus! Grab yourselves some supplies and get to it!
10379,"With all these stairwells, it's not going to be easy─so watch your step!"
10380,"This is it, everyone! With just a bit more effort, we'll at long last be finishin' our work on the Abacus!"
10381,"Help yourself to any materials, and let the pavin' begin!"
10382,"Artisans of Ishgard, I want to see everythin' you've got!"
10383,"Today's task is fixin' up the residence hall we call the Hoarfrost. All together, now!"
10384,"You know where to find the supplies, and you know what to do with 'em! Now look alive!"
10385,The Hoarfrost is no humble little hovel. We're going to need a steady scaffold to do the job!
10386,Today we're goin' to continue work on the scaffold for the Hoarfrost!
10387,"Take all the materials you need, and let's get to work!"
10388,"To scale the heights of the Hoarfrost, our scaffold must reach to the sky!"
10389,I promise you're going to be damned proud of yourself when the Hoarfrost stands in full glory!
10390,"Help yourself to all the materials you need, and don't let up until the work is done!"
10391,"Remember, the building you're workin' on just may be your future home!"
10392,This marks the culmination of all our efforts! Now let's build a residence that'll be the envy of the realm!
10393,We're this close to finishin' work on the Hoarfrost! This is no time to slack off!
10394,"Hear me, artisans? It's time to put the final touches on your masterwork!"
10395,Ugh!
10396,Got a moment?
10397,Don't underestimate chocobos! Especially these red ones all the way from Dalmasca!
10398,Kweh! Kweh! Kweh!
10399,Ha! I'd thought you'd be dead by now! You're stronger than you look!
10400,Why not leave the Resistance and join me instead? Pays well and the grub ain't bad either!
10401,You'd try recruiting your enemy in the middle of a battle!? Unbelievable!
10402,Kweeeh!
10403,And why not? No use in me recruiting you after you're dead!
10404,Kweeeeeeh!
10405,Where did that massive chocobo come from!?
10406,Erk! Better run to fight another day!
10407,It's like the fall of Dalamud all over again! Run for it!
10408,To think it would come to this... Withdraw!
10409,Hmph! Not so tough after all!
10410,Kweh! Kweh! Kweeeh!
10411,Basic motor function checks complete.<hex:02100103>Now for the defensive mechanisms.
10412,I knew those Bozjan churls would arrive sooner or later.
10413,"My creation has performed below expectations.<hex:02100103>Your assistance was most welcome, Bozjans. Until next time!"
10414,"They hardly seem worth killing.<hex:02100103>Perhaps next time, they will put up more of a fight."
10415,"Haha! Excellent work, my friend!"
10416,"Nope, bugger this.<hex:02100103>Time to run!"
10417,"The enemy is here, and they've brought their pets!"
10418,Let them come. My flames will consume them all!
10419,My beasts will sup on your flesh!
10420,"Without their master, they will fall into disarray!"
10421,Take this!
10422,Lyon will never forgive me!
10423,"And let that be a lesson, you curs!"
10424,Like lambs to the slaughter!
10425,We must regroup!
10426,I doubt they'll offer much sport.
10427,It must be here. Keep looking!
10428,Watch out for Bozjans. We can't let them interfere!
10429,Understood...
10430,Executing orders...
10431,Test subject confirmed...
10432,That's our opponent!?<hex:02100103>Doesn't look like much of a threat to me!
10433,What did I say? We had them beaten from the outset!
10434,"So much for the power of magitek, eh?"
10435,I'll grind you beneath my heel!
10436,This isn't my idea of a fair fight.<hex:02100103>Time to call it a day!
10437,Bring me as many parts as you can!
10438,"Troops, fall back! We'll handle this."
10439,"You'll have to do better than that, Bozjans!"
10440,"That should put them in their place.<hex:02100103>All right, everyone. Return to the castrum."
10441,Warrior of Darkness! Thank goodness you're here!
10442,These phantoms have been appearing out of thin air!
10443,Time to get serious.
10444,Nowhere to hide!
10445,"If there's one thing being a beastmaster has taught me,<hex:02100103>it's to watch where you step."
10446,Let's see how resilient you really are!
10447,Understood!
10448,"All right, Bozjans. You've got two options."
10449,"Die facedown in the dirt, or surrender!"
10450,I say we kill 'em!
10451,"You make this look easy, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
10452,I could use someone like you! Why not join me?
10453,<hex:02080CE905FF04>She<hex:FF03>He<hex:03> would never throw in <hex:02080DE905FF04>her<hex:FF04>his<hex:03> lot with the likes of you!
10454,Impressive! That was no mean feat!
10455,Join us!
10456,I'll even give you the choicest cuts of meat!
10457,Oof! Seems I was right about you!
10458,"I'll win you over, just you see!"
10459,"A brute he may be, but he knows talent when he sees it!"
10460,We can't afford to be waylaid here any longer. Withdraw!
10461,"Ha! We'll let you go for now, but one of these days, you'll fight under my banner!"
10462,I'll be waiting!
10463,You won't regret it!
10464,You're too kind!<hex:02100103>I'll leave her and the...horse thing...in your care!
10465,"They have found us, it seems.<hex:02100103>I shall do my part to protect the monoceros!"
10466,"There's the unicorn, and the traitor to boot!<hex:02100103>We need the beast alive, which is more than can be said for the girl!"
10467,We'll show you what happens to deserters!
10468,"You thought you could get away, did you?"
10469,Commencing attack!
10470,Neigh!
10471,"Oh, what's this? A beautiful specimen, fit for inclusion in my menagerie!"
10472,"No! You keep your hands off of him, Clarricie!"
10473,Don't let them escape!
10474,Seize them!
10475,"We need it alive, but don't be afraid to smack some sense into it!"
10476,Neighhh!
10477,You lowly wretch! How dare you!
10478,I'll take this out of your hide!
10479,"I think that's the last of them.<hex:02100103>And yet... No, it must be my mind playing tricks on me."
10480,"Above all, the monoceros is safe.<hex:02100103>You have my sincerest thanks."
10481,<whinny>
10482,"It seems I'm done for...<hex:02100103>Run, my dear monoceros! Save yourself!"
10483,Neighhh!
10484,Let's see how you like this!
10485,Your time is up!
10486,Hyah!
10487,I want that unicorn!<hex:02100103>Slaughter the rest!
10488,Insolent cur!
10489,I have made my choice!
10490,Neigh!
10491,Plenty of meat to go around!
10492,It comes!
10493,Aaah!
10494,Run! Faster!
10495,Stay away! Away I say!
10496,"Someone, help!"
10497,"Is that...? The shark is here! Everyone, to safety!"
10498,Our moment has come! Summon the Bombard!
10499,A raging inferno is at our beck and call!
10500,"Dance, dance!"
10501,Keep going!
10502,Don't stop!
10503,We owe you everything!
10504,How can we repay you?
10505,That beat any fireworks I've seen!
10506,Don't let up! That monster's not long for this fight!
10507,A former menace turned savior... This truly has been a day for surprises.
10508,You're a lifesaver!
10509,I'd be a goner if you hadn't shown up!
10510,Requesting pod support.
10511,I see...light...
10512,You won't escape!
10513,Target acquired.
10514,Fine... If you insist...
10515,Gri...nd...
10516,Cr...ush...
10517,Brea...k...
10518,Trans...fer...
10519,May these brave soldiers finally find freedom...in the hereafter.
10520,Dyunbu! The Bozjans are here!
10521,Then we've no choice but to fight.<hex:02100103>For Gabranth!
10522,Charge!
10523,Keep them away from Dyunbu!
10524,When will they open their eyes?<hex:02100103>Our cause is just!
10525,We're the ones fighting in the name of freedom!<hex:02100103>You're just dogs serving the Garlean oppressors!
10526,How can you betray your people and give your lives for those tyrants!?
10527,"We serve Gabranth, a man of honor!<hex:02100103>He would bring peace and equality for all!"
10528,Then what of we Bozjans!?<hex:02100103>He would have us all killed to the last man!
10529,"You're wrong! He seeks unity, not division!"
10530,So...this is the end...
10531,For Dyunbu...I'd die a thousand deaths...
10532,No! We were supposed to see this through...together!
10533,You monsters! I'll never forgive you! Never!
10534,You're just gonna let them get away?
10535,"They have their reasons to fight, the same as us."
10536,Perhaps there's still a chance for us to see eye to eye.
10537,Not bad for a bunch of wand-wavers!<hex:02100103>Let's fall back for now!
10538,I won't...let you win!
10539,"At this rate, the castrum will be ours before long."
10540,Damned Resistance! This is as far as you go!
10541,"So, they've bolstered their ranks with beasts, have they?<hex:02100103>No matter, we'll crush them all the same!"
10542,"Beasts they may be, but they too shall learn to fear Gunnhildr's Blades."
10543,Not you again...<hex:02100103>Haven't you already spilled enough blood!?
10544,"Stand back, lass.<hex:02100103>You'll only get in the way."
10545,"I'll not take orders from you, churl!<hex:02100103>Who are you to deny me my vengeance!?"
10546,"You'll pay for what you've done, for the friends you've slain!"
10547,Revenge will not bring them back.<hex:02100103>It will only lead to more suffering.
10548,What do you know of suffering!?<hex:02100103>I'll teach you the meaning of pain!
10549,It seems we will soon be reunited...
10550,Ungh! The direct approach isn't working!<hex:02100103>We need to fall back and think this through!
10551,The desire for revenge is strong indeed...
10552,Time to cut our losses!
10553,"Ah, the Resistance, and not a moment too soon.<hex:02100103>Now, you shall face the might of my magitek!"
10554,More worthless toys.<hex:02100103>My blade will make short work of them.
10555,"You may have gained the upper hand, but my flames yet long to feast on your living flesh!"
10556,I shall scatter your ash on the wind!
10557,"Keep your wits about you, lads.<hex:02100103>Old he may be, but this one is not to be underestimated."
10558,Hold your ground!
10559,There is only one thing for it.<hex:02100103>Fight fire with fire!
10560,I hope you've saved a few for me!
10561,Never fear! These paltry foes shall be dashed against my shield!
10562,"My, my. More and more of them are crawling out of the woodwork."
10563,Strength in numbers will not spare them from the inferno!
10564,To die a warrior's death...<hex:02100103>Better that than be claimed by old age.
10565,"I had judged them to be no better than the rank and file, but I was mistaken."
10566,"Sartauvoir, Albeleo has ordered that we proceed to the next phase!"
10567,"Then our excursion is at an end.<hex:02100103>Until we next meet, Bozjans."
10568,Hmm... I fear we haven't seen the last of them.
10569,"Next phase, eh? I don't like the sound of that."
10570,"Hah! Do not be fooled, my friends. 'Tis merely cowardice!<hex:02100103>And now, the path to the castrum lies before us."
10571,My blade... Has it failed me?
10572,Simpleton! Your steel is no match for all-consuming flame!
10573,Let's fall back for the time being.<hex:02100103>It seems we were ill prepared.
10574,"Prepare all you like, it will avail you naught."
10575,You there! I recognize you.
10576,Were you not hired as a dung-sweeper for my menagerie?
10577,"On second thought, I could never employ such an unsightly creature."
10578,Perhaps you can provide my pets with suitable sport.
10579,"Blaz, Velibor! Looks like we've got our work cut out for us."
10580,Do not allow your concentration to lapse even for a moment!
10581,Hmph! A moment is all it'll take to finish this.
10582,"Not much of a challenge, are you?<hex:02100103>Allow me to put you out of your misery."
10583,Such ferocity!
10584,Ha! I'll show them who's fierce!
10585,"So far, so good. But it's not over yet!"
10586,You swine! I'll tear you limb from limb!
10587,My beasts will dine on your flesh!
10588,I'm not done yet!
10589,"When next we meet, you won't be so lucky!"
10590,Ha! That showed her!
10591,"Indeed, though her beasts almost got the better of us."
10592,"What's more, she got away!"
10593,"Today is not a good day to die. We withdraw, for now."
10594,This isn't going so well. Let's regroup!
10595,Damn it all!
10596,"If you won't listen to sense, I'll have to beat some into you!"
10597,Nowhere to hide!
10598,Let's see how resilient you really are!
10599,Understood. Loading program...
10600,Evaluating evasive capacity...
10601,"My heart, i-i-it─<hex:02100103>...Functionality confirmed."
10602,Why...are we here?
10603,Cut...enemy...
10604,Haha...ha...
10605,They'd seek to establish a supply point in the middle of a battlefield?
10606,"Not if I have any say in the matter!<hex:02100103>Quickly, destroy those crates!"
10607,The Resistance is here already!?<hex:02100103>I knew this was a bad idea...
10608,Cowards! You would depend on machines to fight your battles!?
10609,They have us beaten.<hex:02100103>We must regroup!
10610,"Aye, sir!"
10611,They'll regret this!
10612,This'll be over before it's even begun!
10613,You rebel scum.
10614,You shall not interfere with our plans!
10615,Defend those crates!
10616,I'd no idea they'd be so...stubborn.
10617,Gods damn them!
10618,Our best wasn't good enough...
10619,Your villainy ends here!
10620,I've a score to settle!
10621,"Hold on, everyone! Help is on the way!"
10622,Fwaaagh!
10623,BURN! BURN!
10624,Gaaagh!
10625,TO ASHES!
10626,We are not amused...
10627,This dance will light a flame in your heart!
10628,"No attacking, just dancing!"
10629,We need help or we're done for!
10630,Graaaaaah!
10631,Hraaaaaagh... AAAAAARGH!
10632,What is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
10633,I've never seen such a beast before...
10634,We'd best report this to Bajsaljen!
10635,URGE TO BLOW...RISING!
10636,YOUR DOOM IS NIGH!
10637,So you're one of Lyon's underlings?
10638,How dare you speak his name!
10639,Grrraaah!
10640,Where do you think you're going?<hex:02100103>I'll teach you some obediance!
10641,Is this all I am capable of!?
10642,Hernais! Your sacrifice will not be forgotten!
10643,So that was Hernais? A worthy foe.
10644,It's no use! We're no match for these fiends!
10645,"I'm sorry sir, but I've no choice but to withdraw!"
10646,In the name of Lyon!
10647,Graaagggh!
10648,Go!
10649,That's it!
10650,Just a little more!
10651,Hah hah! Wait up!
10652,Hah!
10653,It's done!
10654,Summer is saved!
10655,Back to the faire!
10656,After you!
10657,Time to party!
10658,Grrrrrr...
10659,GET BACK. EXPLOSION IMMINENT!
10660,We'll never see the likes of that Bombard again... Your explosive sacrifice won't soon be forgotten.
10661,Lyon! It's time to put the skills you taught me to good use!
10662,Graaaaaagh!
10663,Here they come.
10664,Murder...death...kill...
10665,If I kill just a few more...I can finally go home!
10666,Activate!
10667,Commencing battle!
10668,"This is test subject VIII, Dabog.<hex:02100103>Armaments primed. Initiating extermination."
10669,Wh-What am I doing here?<hex:02100103>What have I done!?
10670,"This is...test subject VIII, Dabog. Energy levels below minimum.<hex:02100103>Combat capabilities severely compromised. Returning to base."
10671,Enemy targets suppressed.<hex:02100103>Returning to base.
10672,Now to test the efficacy of my alterations...
10673,COMBAT PARAMETERS UPDATED.<hex:02100103>DESTRUCTIVE CAPABILITIES INCREASED.
10674,SYSTEM DAMAGE: 95%.<hex:02100103>INITIATING COMBAT ZONE EXTRACTION SEQUENCE...
10675,I shall have to make further improvements.
10676,"Members of the Resistance, I must thank you for your part in my experiments.<hex:02100103>Until next time, my test subjects."
10677,Data gleaned from such underwhelming test subjects is of no use to me.
10678,CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT DATA LOADED.<hex:02100103>INITIATING MASSACRE MODE.
10679,Now to gauge the resilience of these test subjects.
10680,COMBAT PARAMETERS UPDATED.<hex:02100103>DESTRUCTIVE CAPABILITIES INCREASED.
10681,SYSTEM DAMAGE: 95%.<hex:02100103>INITIATING COMBAT ZONE EXTRACTION SEQUENCE...
10682,"With a few more modifications, my warmachina will be unstoppable.<hex:02100103>Your assistance in the trial was most appreciated, Bozjans."
10683,Such worthless specimens. This has barely scratched the surface of my warmachina's capabilities.
10684,Do <hex:021A020203>try<hex:021A020103> to stay alive long enough to provide useful data.
10685,Anni...hi...late...
10686,Those beasts aren't from around here.<hex:02100103>They must belong to the Empire!
10687,"Whatever they are, they're in my way!"
10688,With me!
10689,You heard him!
10690,"With a Blade on our side, we can't lose!"
10691,Graaagh!
10692,Such slovenly beasts are no match for me!
10693,So that's the power of Gunnhildr's Blades...<hex:02100103>Just like in the legends!
10694,Ungh... What drives these fiends!?<hex:02100103>The day is lost. Retreat!
10695,"Even with a Blade in our ranks, we still lost?"
10696,Grrragh!
10697,Mission failed.<hex:02100103>Commencing strategic retreat.
10698,I see imperials!<hex:02100103>Let's give them what for!
10699,I'll lead the charge!
10700,...
10701,"Problem, Blaz?"
10702,I sense a disturbance of some sort.<hex:02100103>We should proceed with caution.
10703,Ack!
10704,D-D-Demons!
10705,"What's worse, I don't think these ones are on our side!"
10706,This is all we need!
10707,This is the source of the disturbance.
10708,Only one thing for it!
10709,Ha! I barely even broke a sweat!
10710,This troubles me deeply.
10711,The imperials were as surprised by those things as we were.
10712,Discretion is the better part of valor.<hex:02100103>Withdraw!
10713,Let's rendezvous back at base!
10714,Curses!
10715,It's Cassard! And he's brought help from Mord Souq!
10716,No small coup to roll that boulder over!
10717,Look! It's our friends from Mord Souq!
10718,It's Cassard! And he's brought help from Mord Souq!
10719,No small coup to roll that boulder over!
10720,Our friends have come to our aid!
10721,Magnus! We're in your debt!
10722,Pleased am I to see that more Talos have been restored.
10723,A Talos? It could only be Magnus!
10724,We must go and thank them afterwards!
10725,Thanks for clearing the way!
10726,"Much obliged, you two!"
10727,Thaffe and Jeryk are here too!
10728,Thaffe and Jeryk are here too!
10729,"Much obliged, you two!"
10730,"Whoever you are, you're not stopping us!"
10731,This one's aether shines bright. A foe to be reckoned with.
10732,We can't lose! We won't!
10733,This one's aether shines bright. A foe to be reckoned with.
10734,Doubtless no ordinary hero whence he doth hail.
10735,"Our thanks, Feo Ul!"
10736,Feo Ul! You came!
10737,We would be hard-pressed to find stouter aid.
10738,That the king themself should attend...
10739,That the king themself should attend...
10740,A portal. Let us see where it leads.
10741,The Fuath! For once I'm glad to see them!
10742,"Is this just a dream, or are the Fuath really helping us?"
10743,'Tis a strange time indeed when the Fuath lend their aid unconditionally.
10744,'Tis a strange time indeed when the Fuath lend their aid unconditionally.
10745,"Tell me, Urianger... Where <hex:021A020203>did<hex:021A020103> you learn that water-walking charm?"
10746,"The amaro, too, fight with us!"
10747,Even the amaro have joined the fray!
10748,"Thank you, everyone!"
10749,"All of the fae folk, rallying to us... This doth verge upon a miracle."
10750,"All of the fae folk, rallying to us... This doth verge upon a miracle."
10751,We owe it to them to see this through!
10752,We're getting past you one way or another!
10753,"Her aether is dark, but within I see a glimmer of radiance."
10754,Her light... It has a sad tinge to it...
10755,"Her aether is dark, but within I see a glimmer of radiance."
10756,Another noble soul reduced to a means to an end...
10757,"You're a godssend, Feo Ul! Thank everyone for us!"
10758,"When the king commands, even the forest must obey..."
10759,"Look, a path has opened up!"
10760,"You have our gratitude, Feo Ul!"
10761,"On to Lakeland, then!"
10762,I see it! The Crystal Tower!
10763,Another stretch and we're home free.
10764,That such a passage should exist...
10765,That such a passage should exist...
10766,Let's keep moving right along!
10767,"They're a little rough-hewn, but their hearts are in the right place."
10768,"Not bad, you lot!"
10769,"Are they your friends, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>?"
10770,"Not bad, you lot!"
10771,I won't be outdone!
10772,"Good gods, who in the world punches like that?"
10773,Let's leave them to it and press on!
10774,"Please be safe, all of you!"
10775,"Good gods, who in the world punches like that?"
10776,"Actually, Sister, when you're angry... Ahem. Never mind."
10777,"Hmph, the bigger they are...!"
10778,Have care─his aether is far denser than the rest!
10779,Seriously? This is a <hex:021A020203>real<hex:021A020103> person somewhere?
10780,Have care─his aether is far denser than the rest!
10781,"Whatever the brute's got, I'll bear the brunt of it!"
10782,"They're here, right on cue!"
10783,For Hernais!
10784,Havoc! ...Did I do that right?
10785,Grrrrrr!
10786,What ugly creatures! And their hounds are even worse!
10787,That did the trick!
10788,"Take that, imperial scum!"
10789,"Hernais, we have failed you!"
10790,Retreat!
10791,This isn't working! We'll have to withdraw!
10792,Cowards! Come back and let our dogs finish the job!
10793,Hernais will be proud!
10794,"Greetings, Blade <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0303>! Can you spare a moment?"
10795,I'd best get going. Thanks for all your help!
10796,"Not to worry. There'll be other chances, I'm sure!"
10797,You're mine!
10798,I have you now!
10799,"Come to dash yourselves against my magitek, have you?"
10800,Your sacrifice is most welcome.<hex:02100103>The data I retrieve will be employed to wreak untold destruction on your pathetic friends!
10801,Initiate attack formation D.<hex:02100103>Now to measure the enemy's resilience to my weaponry.
10802,Most unexpected.<hex:02100103>I wonder how they will fare against <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>?
10803,How intriguing...<hex:02100103>Time to conclude the test and dispose of these specimens.
10804,Impossible!<hex:02100103>Could I have made a miscalculation?
10805,Ha! Is that all you can muster!?
10806,It seems these Resistance troops are capable of performing above their estimated combat parameters.
10807,"When next we meet, I shall dispose of you once and for all!"
10808,Yaaarrrgh!
10809,Earth writhe and rage!
10810,Alermuc is ours!<hex:02100103>We've won!
10811,That Lyon fellow is not one to be trifled with...
10812,
10813,
10814,That's the way!
10815,You have them now!
10816,Finish them!
10817,Just a little more!
10818,This might sting a little.
10819,"Oh, we're just getting started!"
10820,"Keep dancing around if you want, but it won't save you."
10821,"Think you're tough, eh?"
10822,"Not thinking of running, are you?"
10823,Now I've got you!
10824,There is no escape!
10825,"Welcome to my secret sanctuary! Make yourself at home, for this time of treasures and tribulations will not soon come to an end!"
10826,"Yes, yes, it is time to begin! Shall we have a trifling glamour to liven up this fortuitous meeting?"
10827,Tee hee hee! I'm glad you came to play with me!
10828,Edam ev'uoy ssem a hcus.<hex:02100103>Swish-swish-aroo!
10829,Enod reven si krow ym.<hex:02100103>Swish-swish-aroo!

10832,<squeal> <squeal> <squeal>
10833,"Well, well! It seems I've been called into the fray!"
10834,"Bravo, bravo! I see that luck is on your side...for now!"
10835,Hmmm... How are we to pass?
10836,<gasp>
10837,"Do you feel that, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>?"
10838,I pray your spirit may at last find rest.
10839,Watch your step. I sense something amiss here...
10840,"I think we are safe. For the moment, at least."
10841,"Well fought, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>."
10842,Let us see where this portal leads.
10843,This way.
10844,They've...retreated...?
10845,May they find peace in the aetherial sea.
10846,These stairs appear to be safe.
10847,I believe the worst is past. Though there is still no sign of Misija.
10848,What is that light...?
10849,
10850,
10851,Bok-bok BAKAWK!
10852,Cluck cluck!
10853,
10854,Argh! Wh-What sorcery is this!?
10855,Understood!
10856,No you don't!
10857,<huff> <huff>
10858,Ungh...
10859,Is it still not enough...?
10860,I'm beginning the incantation!
10861,Time for the chain!
10862,In the name of the queen!
10863,Those who play are already lost.
10864,Your demise is ordained.
10865,Weapons armed.
10866,By this sword!
10867,By this shield!
10868,I shall cleave you asunder!
10869,Dash yourselves against me!
10870,Know the weight of this burden...
10871,"Heavy as a feather, yet light as stone."
10872,I am all and I am none... Who am I?
10873,Do you <hex:021A020203>see<hex:021A020103>?
10874,"Be still, that your death be clean."
10875,We stand aligned!
10876,We see your end!
10877,We know your moves!
10878,We strike as one!
10879,Lives...shall be forfeit...
10880,You shall...not...pass...
10881,The end...is nigh...
10882,"Come, my blades. Defend your queen!"
10883,Begone with you!
10884,Kneel!
10885,You dare defy me!?
10886,Enough!
10887,In the name of the queen!
10888,Long live the queen!
10889,"Hmph. An admirable effort, Bajsaljen, I'll give you that."
10890,I will end you!
10891,You won't find mercy here!
10892,You brought this on yourselves!
10893,No you don't!
10894,We mustn't give up!
10895,We must stop them here!
10896,Yield and we may yet show mercy!
10897,My brothers and sisters have suffered enough!
10898,For Bozja!
10899,We must protect Alisaie!
10900,"Here you are, Alisaie!"
10901,"Here it comes, Alisaie!"
10902,Lend me your aether!
10903,More! I need more aether!
10904,Just a little more!
10905,What's the matter with you!? Fight harder!
10906,"Crush them! Defeat, destroy, crush!"
10907,"Finish them fast! Swiftly, quickly, fast!"
10908,"Release the special unit! Unchain, unleash, release!"
10909,We're set with supplies─now it's up to us to put them to good use!
10910,Our work begins in the western Risensong Quarter! Let's clear the rubble so the city can rise again!
10911,I know it's been a while for some of you. Remember: safety always comes first!
10912,"All right! It's time to begin concerted works. Everyone together, now!"
10913,Our next task is to tidy up the western Risensong Quarter. I want it lookin' spotless!
10914,Clean up the fine debris and clear a path to the construction sites!
10915,We've an ample supply of materials. Let's get the concerted works underway!
10916,"It's time to pave the western Risensong Quarter! Help yourselves to supplies from the piles, and let's get to work!"
10917,Look at these streets! The task is almost done─don't lose focus till the end!
10918,"In this round of concerted works, we'll be buildin' residences in the western Risensong Quarter."
10919,You'll find all the materials you need in the supply piles. Now let's get building!
10920,I don't want to see a single brick out of place! Can't have a cold draft sneakin' in on a cold winter's night.
10921,"For this round of concerted works, we'll be buildin' still more residences."
10922,Time to put the finishin' touches on these houses! All the materials you need are in the supply piles─let's keep it moving!
10923,Let's give them houses befittin' a district of class and culture!
10924,"Supplies, check! All right, everyone─let's get the concerted works off the ground!"
10925,"We've got more houses what need buildin'! Help yourself to the supplies, and let's show them what we can do!"
10926,"As they say, home is where the heart is. Let's give our residents abodes they'll be happy to return to on a cold Ishgardian night!"
10927,"All as one, now, everyone! Commence the concerted works!"
10928,These houses are lookin' more livable by the moment! Grab the last batch of supplies and let's finish the job!
10929,"This is your time to shine, artisans! Don't slack off until the job is done!"
10930,"Ready, skybuilders? It's time to show what you're made of!"
10931,More houses is the order of the day! Now grab some supplies an' start buildin'!
10932,This residence quarter's goin' to be in high demand. Let's build houses people will be proud to call home!
10933,"The materials have been assembled, so let's get the concerted works underway!"
10934,"Just a bit more work, and these houses will be fit for livin'. Keep it up, skybuilders!"
10935,"Once these houses go up, our work in the western Risensong Quarter will be complete! This is no time to slacken off!"
10936,"For today's round of concerted efforts, we'll be gettin' to work on Bright Ballad's Passage."
10937,"Help yourself to the materials you need, and let's get to buildin'!"
10938,Let's put up a portal worthy of bein' the gateway between the Firmament and the Pillars!
10939,It's that time again─time for the next round of concerted works! Let's polish up Bright Ballad's Passage to a fine sheen!
10940,"You know where to find the supplies, so let's get to it!"
10941,"With another major portal of entry, the Firmament's sure to be livelier than ever!"
10942,We commence concerted works in the eastern Risensong Quarter! Let's see those legs and arms moving!
10943,First order of the day is clearin' out all this debris! Let's get to smashin'!
10944,Combine your efforts an' we'll have this place fit for buildin' in no time!
10945,That'll do! It's time to proceed to the next round of concerted works!
10946,Our next task is to clean up any leftover specks of fine debris.
10947,I want this place lookin' spotless!
10948,"Good work, skybuilders! We move to the next phase of concerted works!"
10949,Next we'll be paving the main thoroughfare of this part of the district. Help yourself to the supplies and let's get to work!
10950,A house's only as good as its foundation! I don't want to see a single stone out of place!
10951,It's time to raise the walls for a new block of residences. I want to see you working in perfect concert!
10952,"Now grab yourself some materials from the supply piles, and let's get buildin'!"
10953,This is where you put your skills to work! Let's build residences that will keep the residents of Risensong warm on the coldest of nights!
10954,"Our collectors worked hard to bring us these materials, so let's do our damndest to make sure they don't go to waste!"
10955,The completion of our task is almost nigh! This is no time to ease up!
10956,"It's time to show Ishgard─nay, the entire realm─your pride and skill as crafters!"
10957,We've a full inventory of supplies! Time to commence concerted works!
10958,"Next, we've more residences to build! Help yourself to the supplies you need and commence construction!"
10959,This will be the last block of residences to grace the Firmament! I want to see your most masterful work yet!
10960,"The end is in sight, skybuilders! With the completion of this task, our works in the eastern Risensong Quarter will be complete!"
10961,"These residences are still just a shell of what they need to be! We've no shortage of supplies, so let's start buildin'!"
10962,It's up to us to raise houses that any Ishgardian would be proud to live in!
10963,"All right, everyone! It's time to begin work on Snowsoak Springs, a bathhouse where all Ishgardians can wash their worries away!"
10964,"What are you waitin' for? You see the supplies, so let's get to workin'!"
10965,"Just think: a soothin' soak awaits you, too─but not until you're done with your task!"
10966,And we're set to go. Let the concerted works begin!
10967,Those supplies aren't going to carry themselves. Let's get to work!
10968,"Works on Snowsoak Springs have entered the final phase! Ahh, I can just feel the soothin' waters washin' over me!"
10969,"We've done it, skybuilders! The restoration effort is all but complete! All that remains is to raise a monument to our efforts!"
10970,See those piles of supplies? I reckon you know what to do with 'em!
10971,"Huzzah! Huzzah! The Firmament has risen to its full glory! You've done Ishgard proud, skybuilders─this is a day that will be sung of for ages to come!"
10972,Grrraaah! Flesh! Give me flesh!
10973,Stomp intruders!
10974,Fickle floor! Hehehe!
10975,Heads roll! Grrroooaaarrr!!!
10976,No escape!
10977,Smash intruders!
10978,Intruders stumble! Intruders die!
10979,Intruders small! Intruders weak!
10980,Get in my belly! Grrroooaaarrr!!!
10981,Burn intruders!
10982,Bring all to bear!!!
10983,No way out!
10984,Away! Away!!!
10985,Intruders tumble! Intruders die!
10986,Drown intruders!
10987,Grrroooaaaaaahhh!!!
10988,Mooore! Mooorrreee!!!
10989,Off with their heads!
10990,Why won't you diiieee!!!
10991,All to ashes!
10992,Despair shall subsume those who disturb our rest!
10993,"Yes, let the dark consume you!"
10994,"There is no leaving this place, mortals!"
10995,"Wayward souls of old, I bid you rise!"
10996,You know nothing of pain!
10997,"There is no leaving this place, mortals!"
10998,"Rise, my brothers, rise! Let us add these wayward souls to our number!"
10999,The dark shall consume all!
11000,Succumb to the paralyzing power of fear!
11001,Grrroooaaarrr!!! Grind bones to dust!
11002,Rip flesh from bones!
11003,Rip and teeeaaarrr!!!
11004,Nowhere to run! Nowhere to hide!
11005,Smash together!
11006,Grrroooaaaaaahhh!!!
11007,Run and die!
11008,Strike twice! Strike dead!
11009,Curse intruders!
11010,Intruders suffer! Intruders despair!
11011,Doom comes!
11012,Curse intruders!
11013,More suffering! More despair!
11014,Intruders stubborn! Foolish!
11015,Intruders never leave alive!  Grrroooaaarrr!!!
11016,Prepare to witness an ancient Far Eastern ritual!
11017,Do not be shy now. The more the merrier!
11018,"Huh, this could be interesting..."
11019,Might be worth a watch.
11020,"Oh, I can't wait."
11021,It is time for a fight most ferocious: one between man and beast!
11022,"Now, watch as my apprentice summons the fearsome Byakko from the folding screen!"
11023,<grunt>
11024,Behold!
11025,Do not fear! We have a noble warrior at hand ready to slay the foul feline.
11026,Oh my!
11027,I can scarce believe my eyes!
11028,"Byakko possesses a bulky frame, but he is more agile than most men!"
11029,Byakko is more than capable of bewitching any foes that let their guard down.
11030,Byakko is on his last legs! The noble warrior's victory is imminent!
11031,The beast is slain and with that the land has been successfully purified.
11032,This marks the end of our ritual. We do hope you found it to your liking.
11033,"Look, the tiger's returned to the folding screen!"
11034,Now I've seen it all...
11035,Oh dear. It would appear our noble warrior has failed! Byakko has fled to fight another day.
11036,Is that not a problem?
11037,Do not fret. That Byakko was merely an illusion. It cannot sustain its form indefinitely.
11038,"Well, that's good to know."
11039,A fiercer feline I have never seen.
11040,It is...beautiful.
11041,"Ah, Tenzen..."
11042,That's it!
11043,This all feels oddly familiar...
11044,Are tigers not usually a bit more agile?
11045,Do not falter!
11046,Splendid strike!
11047,Quite the spectacle...
11048,Are we certain that's not a real tiger?
11049,<hex:026003023403>An Open tournament is currently in session!<hex:02100103>Head to Card Square to sign up and put your Triple Triad talents to the test!
11050,I'll burn you to ash!
11051,May lightning smite you!
11052,An imitation of...Progenitrix!
11053,An imitation of...Ultros!
11054,An imitation of...Durinn!
11055,An imitation of...the shikigami of the pyre!
11056,An imitation of...the shikigami of the undertow!
11057,An imitation of...Siegfried!
11058,An imitation of...Papa Humbaba!
11059,I will erase you from my stage!
11060,This shall be a whirlwind tour!
11061,A good performer never freezes!
11062,So this is the workshop...
11063,I never thought I would see this place again.
11064,"Right, let's create the mother of all porxies!"
11065,I never thought I would see this place again.
11066,We will be counting on your local knowledge.
11067,The facility itself still seems to be in good shape. 
11068,"What creatures have since taken up residence, I wonder..."
11069,"So we clear out any pests we encounter, yes?"
11070,"What creatures have since taken up residence, I wonder..."
11071,"Whatever they are, we'll make short work of them."
11072,Looks just about as friendly as the rest.
11073,Time to finish tidying up the area.
11074,So that's the keeper of the clay.
11075,Is that supposed to be a golem?
11076,Aye. This is what happens when you neglect to tidy up.
11077,"Yes! Excellent work, everyone!"
11078,One ingredient struck off the list.
11079,"This is fine clay, perfect for our porxie!"
11080,"Yes! Excellent work, everyone!"
11081,"If I didn't know better, I would say you were having fun."
11082,So back here again and on to the next task.
11083,"So, what's next? Water?"
11084,"A workshop this vast, it certainly makes sense to have portals."
11085,"So, what's next? Water?"
11086,That's right─water to work the clay.
11087,A well-kept area. No doubt thanks to the familiars.
11088,How often did I come here to fetch water for Master Matoya's tea...
11089,That gushing sound... There must be a water vein.
11090,That gushing sound... There must be a water vein.
11091,"Correct, and believe me when I say it's icy cold. Watch your step."
11092,What in the world is that thing?
11093,"Oh gods, it's still here..."
11094,Some manner of sprite? Or another familiar?
11095,That familiar was made with stormwater─and it plays rough. Have care.
11096,When even Y'shtola advises caution...
11097,"As with all things, one cannot judge a familiar by its appearance."
11098,Nothing is so bothersome as a familiar made by an untrained hand.
11099,"The water was freezing, but at least it washed the mud away."
11100,"Ahhh, to have closure after all these years..."
11101,Wait... Was it <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> who created that familiar!?
11102,All proceeding apace thus far!
11103,Master Matoya will be getting impatient─assuming she hasn't fallen asleep.
11104,"Ugh, I'm freezing in my sodden clothes..."
11105,"Ugh, I'm freezing in my sodden clothes..."
11106,"Worry not, you will be warm again soon. <hex:021A020203>Very<hex:021A020103> warm."
11107,"Good heavens, is the magma <hex:021A020203>rainbow-colored<hex:021A020103>? Spectacular!"
11108,"Ungh, the aether here is so vivid, I can scarcely see..."
11109,These colors... I take it the magma is infused with the elements.
11110,"Good heavens, is the magma <hex:021A020203>rainbow-colored<hex:021A020103>? Spectacular!"
11111,"The product of dissolved crystals, lest you wonder."
11112,And now the kiln should be lit!
11113,"Whew, I shall be glad to leave this stifling place behind."
11114,Such an aether-rich heat source will be perfect for porxie-making.
11115,And now the kiln should be lit!
11116,"Aye, let us return to Master Matoya."
11117,"So for the finishing touches, we employ...brute force?"
11118,A pugnacious specimen...just like its creator.
11119,Regal raiment? Really?
11120,Regal raiment? Really?
11121,"Garb aside, I suspect the creature will be anything but regal."
11122,"Alisaie, are you all right!?"
11123,Keep your guard up.
11124,This is only the beginning.
11125,They can come from anywhere. Stay alert.
11126,"Aye, Admiral."
11127,Damn it...
11128,Argh...
11129,Ungh...
11130,Admiral!
11131,"Ahhh! My head! The pain, the pain!"
11132,"You have our thanks, Mikoto."
11133,"Indeed. Without your magicks, we would be done for."
11134,Everyone back! I will shield Alisaie!
11135,"Go ahead, 9S."
11136,Use the pods.
11137,Enemy sighted!
11138,Stay focused.
11139,There's the leader.
11140,Let's get back to 9S.
11141,Oh no you don't!
11142,Don't get distracted. Focus on the mission.
11143,Stay alert. These readings are...
11144,Time to move.
11145,I'm aware.
11146,An elevator?
11147,"Enemy units! 9S, cover Anogg."
11148,Is that it?
11149,Did that say “gates”?
11150,We should be able to move it using this panel.
11151,Be careful!
11152,I'm not picking up any more hostiles.
11153,Waugh! What's that!?
11154,"Wait, the network is a <hex:021A020203>place<hex:021A020103>?"
11155,You first.
11156,"Still not enjoying the creepy voice, thanks!"
11157,Good luck! Don't die!
11158,Well done!
11159,What the─!?
11160,Do they...have feelings too?
11161,"Well, you know what to do!"
11162,There's no choice. We do it.
11163,More!?
11164,Everyone all right?
11165,Gather as many eggs as you can!
11166,Wretched curs...
11167,Forward...
11168,Glory be... Glory be...
11169,Take this!
11170,Hah!
11171,Give no quarter!
11172,Charge!
11173,Fools you were to come here!
11174,"Now you face the raging storm, netherlings!"
11175,"Stand firm, unyielding as stone!"
11176,"Die, wicked fleshling!"
11177,You cannot hope to defeat us!
11178,These ones will never surrender!
11179,Hold still! These ones will heal friendly fighting ones!
11180,"Now roar, Tizona!"
11181,This is as far as you go!
11182,"Punch first, ask questions later!"
11183,You'll have to do better than that!
11184,Prepare yourself!
11185,A poor display.
11186,Hyah!
11187,Pray return to your senses!
11188,We are counting on you!
11189,Have faith and victory shall be ours.
11190,This way!
11191,"With me, Alisaie!"
11192,Unnngh...
11193,Glory be...
11194,For victory!
11195,Power from beyond!
11196,
11197,"What, can't keep up?"
11198,I'll cut you to shreds!
11199,Must...kill...
11200,Get out of my head!
11201,I'm truly in your debt...
11202,There...
11203,Is that all of them?
11204,T-Too strong...
11205,For the Empire!
11206,Hrnghhh...
11207,Graaagh!
11208,Can't...move...
11209,I've let my guard down!
11210,Stay close to me!
11211,<pant> <pant>
11212,Look out!
11213,Haaaaaa...!
11214,I do not like the look of that...
11215,Leave this one to me!
11216,Graaaaaagh!
11217,Aaah!
11218,TO SPLINTERS! TO SPLINTERS!
11219,FREEZE! FREEZE!
11220,GRAAAAAAGH!
11221,BRRRRRRGH! RRRRRRGH!
11222,I tire of these games!
11223,Charging cannons...
11224,Target locked.
11225,Taste my steel!
11226,Down with you!
11227,You'll not escape this time!
11228,"Now, hold still..."
11229,Neighhh!
11230,"Go, Monoceros!"
11231,I-It summons the dead!?
11232,For Bozja!
11233,Forward! Forward!
11234,Hold steady!
11235,Raaah!
11236,Urgh!
11237,The battle begins here!
11238,"On your guard, everyone!"
11239,"Onward, men!"
11240,"Well, let us see how its defenses fare against this!"
11241,I see an opening!
11242,I will take this path.
11243,Stay safe.
11244,Hyah!
11245,Take that!
11246,What...what is that...?
11247,By the gods...<hex:02100103>Is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103> the Allagan relic!?
11248,Bozjan curs!
11249,For Gabranth!
11250,Today you die!
11251,Hold nothing back!
11252,"Come, my children. There is work to be done!"
11253,Their flames will sear the flesh from your bones!
11254,Intruder alert!<hex:02100103>Intruder alert!
11255,"Rise from the ashes, and lay waste to our enemies!"
11256,The flames will consume you all!
11257,Time is mine to command. Mine to control!
11258,Is there no end to them!?
11259,We mustn't lose heart!
11260,"Sun, sea, and sandy beaches─there's no place like the Isle of Endless Summer!"
11261,I'm diving in!
11262,Me too!
11263,"Hey! Take it easy, will you?"
11264,What's with all these boxes?
11265,Did they just wash up on shore?
11266,"Is it just me, or is there a chill in the air?"
11267,A chill? It's downright freezing! Brrrrrr...
11268,Uwaaah! M-Monsters!?
11269,"H-Help! Someone, please!"
11270,"It's a Bombard, but...blue?"
11271,Let's get out of here before we freeze to death!
11272,TO SPLINTERS! TO SPLINTERS!
11273,FREEZE! FREEZE!
11274,GRAAAAAAGH!
11275,BRRRRRRGH! RRRRRRGH!
11276,Adjusting tactic protocols...<hex:02100103>Enhancing right arm.
11277,Adjusting tactic protocols...<hex:02100103>Enhancing left arm.
11278,Pursuing target...
11279,Charge!
11280,No quarter!
11281,More! We must have more!
11282,No turning back!
11283,We win or we die!
11284,I cannot go on...
11285,"No way forward, no way back!"
11286,Our best was not enough.
11287,They are too strong...
11288,Gah...!
11289,No...not like this...
11290,I owe you my life.
11291,You would grant me succor?<hex:02100103>Are you not our enemy?
11292,Basch... I have failed you...
11293,Let's keep moving!
11294,
11295,"Terrified, frightened, scared!"
11296,"Thank you, overdweller!<hex:02100103>Let me show you the way!"
11297,What took you so long?
11298,Tsk...
11299,Ha!
11300,Worthless!
11301,You're finished!
11302,The time has come...
11303,So be it.
11304,My children...
11305,May you finally be at peace.
11306,"Fall, damn you!"
11307,Here I come!
11308,The combined might of both dragon and dragoon...
11309,I have misjudged our foe...
11310,Hyah!
11311,Have at you!
11312,Lord Aymeric!<hex:02100103>Let me take care of this!
11313,We are being overwhelmed!
11314,"Today, we fight as one!"
11315,Fall back!
11316,We shall see the wounded to safety.<hex:02100103>You are needed elsewhere!
11317,That should give us a moment's rest.
11318,"Help is on the way.<hex:02100103>Please, hold on a little longer..."
11319,
11320,Stand firm!<hex:02100103>We cannot afford to lose!
11321,We bow down to none!
11322,Glory be...
11323,Glory be to Garlemald...
11324,...to Garlemald...
11325,For the Empire...
11326,F-For Garlemald...
11327,Glory...be...
11328,For the Emp...ire...
11329,Gl-Glory be...to Garlemald...
11330,"There is nowhere left to run, Yamatsumi!<hex:02100103>Give yourself into our custody!"
11331,"We sympathize with your plight, but we will not allow you to subject Bozja to your depravations!"
11332,Spare me your pity!<hex:02100103>We are foes─I accept naught from you but pain and blood!
11333,"Pride of our line, greatest of the shikigami, I summon thee forth!"
11334,"Slay them, yoki!<hex:02100103>Smear their offal upon the rocks!"
11335,"Bah, you try my patience!<hex:02100103>Protect me, shikigami! I command it!"
11336,Is this where our line ends?
11337,It cannot be!<hex:02100103>Yoki is broken!?
11338,The greatest shikigami we have ever commanded... Fallen.
11339,"Come, Yamatsumi! We shall have another chance at revenge!"
11340,"Your quiver of tricks is empty, Yamatsumi.<hex:02100103>Now surrender!"
11341,No... This cannot be...
11342,"Surrender?<hex:02100103>The Urabe will return, stronger than before!"
11343,Hehe... The relic bends to my will. As is to be expected from one with my talents.
11344,"I am master of man and artifact alike, and finally the stage for my masterpiece is set! Haha!"
11345,Where are the advance forces? I see no sign of them.
11346,Grah! Dalmasca. Grrr.
11347,"What was that, Kosyu? These are the selfsame fiends Lady Fran reported sighting in Dalmasca? It can't be!"
11348,Now do you see!? My art is beyond challenge!
11349,Curses!<hex:02100103>We must retreat!
11350,"We will yet prevail, Master Oboro!"
11351,It cannot end...like...this...
11352,The Resistance must pay!
11353,Kill them! Kill them all!
11354,Where...where have they all gone?
11355,For the Beast King!
11356,Lyooon!
11357,Lyon...sir...
11358,"Your task is to make stuffed toys using the materials laid out on the Mattock, kupo."
11359,"Once you've finished sewing together a toy, take it to a wain at the central plaza."
11360,"Make lots of stuffed toys and deliver them all, kupo!"
11361,"We hope you enjoyed that veritable parade of oversized stuffed toys. The next fête is “Shear-a-Yak,” and it will be held at Bright Ballad's Passage!"
11362,"Though you'll be shearing a yak in this fête, instead of shears, you'll be using an enhanced version of the aetheromatic auger: the aetheromatic clipper!"
11363,"Tuned to operate with normal concentrations of aether, it shoots blasts of magicked wind that effortlessly removes fleece from their owners!"
11364,"So get firing at the yak, and bring the fleece it sheds to me, three sacks full at a time!"
11365,"That's all for “Shear-a-Yak.” Now, please take yourselves to the Abacus for the next fête: “Toy Hunter”!"
11366,My swinelings have hidden a lucky toy in one of three present boxes.
11367,"You must open the right box to find the toy, and then bring it to me."
11368,Happy toy hunting!
11369,"Great hunting, everyone. Now, please make your way to the central plaza on the Mattock!"
11370,I bid you welcome to the final fête: “Presents of Mind”!
11371,"In this fête, you must deliver presents to various folk on the Mattock according to the mascots' instructions."
11372,"Upon delivering two presents, the mascot issuing the instructions will change, so be sure to pay attention. Let the gifting begin!"
11373,"It's farewell for now, but we look forward to seeing you again! Till next time!"
11374,Nothing up my sleeves─save my muscular arms─and presto! We have materials!
11375,
11376,
11377,"Thanks for taking part, kupo!"
11378,Just a moment while we prepare.
11379,"Hm, perhaps I need a speech quirk like “kupo” as well..."
11380,
11381,
11382,Wind direction─check. Wind speed─check. Everything is in order!
11383,Thank you for your patience! The fête will now begin!
11384,"Heh heh, our wooly friend looks like a new yak!"
11385,Now it's time for me and my swinelings to get to work!
11386,My massive muscles will make short work of the tidying up.
11387,It's time to hide the toy.
11388,"Are you ready, my swinelings?"
11389,Are we ever!?
11390,"Go forth, then!"
11391,"Yes, yes..."
11392,"Er, I-I suppose..."
11393,Speech quirks are for the weak...kupo.
11394,"This is it, everyone─the final fête."
11395,We mascots are all taking part this time.
11396,Have fun with us till the end!
11397,"The final fête is upon us. Are you ready, my dear mascots?"
11398,"Hear, hear, kupo!"
11399,"Yes, ma'am!"
11400,Huzzah!
11401,Let us finish on a high note!
11402,"Keep your muscles limber, kupo!"
11403,We hope you had as much fun as we did!
11404,Please play with us again!
11405,Brace yourself.
11406,One to go!
11407,
11408,This one's going to hurt.
11409,Hm.
11410,Looks like this goes all the way up.
11411,Die!
11412,Ugh!
11413,Miserable curs!
11414,"Hear ye, hear ye! Fêtes are about to commence!"
11415,"Greetings, friends, and thank you for joining in the Skyrise Celebration!"
11416,
11417,
11418,"Today, we will be hosting a variety of fêtes─the first of which serves as an introduction to our friendly team of mascots."
11419,"Mighty Moogle, at your service, kupo. Made of sterner stuff though I am, I'm in charge of the fête “Made of Softer Stuff”!"
11420,"Chirpy Chocobo is my name, and “Shear-a-Yak” is my game. Under my fluffy wing, you will shear as you've never shorn before!"
11421,"And last but definitely not least, I am Perky Piggy. My swinelings and I look forward to making a “Toy Hunter” out of you!"
11422,"Remember these mascots well, for they will be your guides throughout the revelry. On which note, let us dive into the fête!"
11423,"The mascots will take turns striking their favorite poses, and we ask that you show your celebratory spirit by posing in kind."
11424,Are you ready?
11425,Here is a pose that maximizes your muscular appeal.
11426,"Do the <hex:021A020203>mighty maximizer<hex:021A020103>, and show the fine specimen that you are, kupo!"
11427,
11428,"Before using the aetheromatic clipper, it is important to point and acknowledge."
11429,"To that end, we do the <hex:021A020203>chirpy checker<hex:021A020103>!"
11430,
11431,"When searching for treasure, one must keep one's eyes peeled."
11432,"To help you practice, I bid you do the <hex:021A020203>perky peeler<hex:021A020103> with me!"
11433,
11434,"Hereon, the order will be random."
11435,"Before using the aetheromatic clipper, point and acknowledge with the <hex:021A020203>chirpy checker<hex:021A020103>!"
11436,"When searching for treasure, keep your eyes peeled with the <hex:021A020203>perky peeler<hex:021A020103>!"
11437,"Show the fine specimen that you are with the <hex:021A020203>mighty maximizer<hex:021A020103>, kupo!"
11438,"I trust you are now acquainted with our friendly mascots. With that, let us move right along to the next fête."
11439,"Mighty Moogle, whose big muscles are equaled only by his big heart, awaits you on the Mattock for “Made of Softer Stuff”!"
11440,"My turn to shine, kupo!"
11441,Here we go!
11442,Yaaargh!
11443,"I am Pagaga, beastmaster of the proud line of Vochstein!"
11444,Are there any out there with stones enough to face me and my pets!?
11445,"...You lot? Ahahaha! I was expecting something a little sterner, but very well! Let's see how you fare!"
11446,"Come, Berda! Obda! I've found you some playmates!"
11447,Screech! Screeeeeech!
11448,"That'll do, Berda! That'll do!"
11449,"Away, Obda! I won't have you dying on me!"
11450,To think that my prized beasts could be bested...
11451,Grrr... We'll get you next time! Mark my words!
11452,"Hmph, this the best the Resistance's got? Lyon's fallen far to struggle against your ilk."
11453,Screeeeeech!
11454,What? These monsters were once your allies!?
11455,Grrrgh! Mercy. Graaah!
11456,"They were once, but they are far past saving. He says killing them would be a mercy. I'm of the same mind, Kosyu─let's end this, and quickly."
11457,Impudent rebels. You are hardly worthy to lay eyes upon my masterwork. Grovel for the chance I've afforded you!
11458,"Now, my puppets, dance and leave the world agog with your grace!"
11459,"O, earth beneath me, heed my call! Rise up and crush these Resistance vermin into so much dust!"
11460,"It is time to show what you can do, my minion. Go forth and crush the Resistance underfoot!"
11461,What the─? An ice golem!?
11462,"Hmph, we'll shatter it like the ice it is!"
11463,"Yes, a satisfactory showing..."
11464,We need waste no more time on this rabble.
11465,Let us save our strength for the next mission.
11466,Graaarrrgggh!
11467,"Owww, that hurts! Seriously, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>, you're a <hex:02080FE905FF06>woman<hex:FF04>man<hex:03> after my own heart!"
11468,"<pant> Bugger me, where did my strength go...?"
11469,"Fight harder, you lot! Fight harder!"
11470,We must free them! Target the constricting flames!
11471,
11472,
11473,
11474,Graaarrrgggh!
11475,"Resistance scum. Finally, you show yourselves..."
11476,"Come, my new and improved Dabog! Show these fools the power of Delta Gabriel Kai!"
11477,It is Dabog inside that golden machina? Gods have mercy...
11478,
11479,This is hyperpilot Dabog. Target confirmed. Commencing combat operations...
11480,This is hyperpilot Dabog. Hull damage...confirmed. Firepower...below acceptable parameters.
11481,Deploying long-range assault nodes... Initiating omnidirectional attack...
11482,Dabog! Open your eyes!
11483,This is hyperpilot Dabog. Hull integrity...compromised. Proceeding with combat operations...
11484,Gaaah!
11485,You would do well not to underestimate us!
11486,Is that all?
11487,It means to defend itself?
11488,
11489,
11490,Enemy combat capabilities compromised... Mission...successful.
11491,"Such firepower! Retreat, I say... Retreat!"
11492,From the savior's own hands... Such an honor this is!
11493,<gasp> These are the latest tools! However did you know?
11494,"What might this be?<hex:02100103>...Oho, new masonry tools!"
11495,Thank you! I will treasure this!
11496,
11497,
11498,"Ooh, birch syrup, and quality stuff to boot!"
11499,"Heh heh, I shall enjoy this with my tea!"
11500,"Oho, Ishgardian produce!"
11501,But this is so much! Are you certain?
11502,
11503,
11504,"Ooh, marron glace! My favorite!"
11505,Thank you so much!
11506,<gasp> I've always wanted a toy gaelicat!
11507,"Thank you! Hehe, I like festivals!"
11508,
11509,
11510,Let's get moving!
11511,I do not see any primals...
11512,Something's not right...
11513,We were fortunate on this occasion...
11514,Now it's our turn!
11515,No more games...
11516,"Blade <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0303>, over here!"
11517,Bring the ceruleum to me!
11518,<grunt> I underestimated them...
11519,"Fall back! Everyone, fall back!"
11520,No... How could we fail?
11521,
11522,
11523,
11524,
11525,Oh my. So many lambs to lead to the slaughter.
11526,"Centurion Gilbrisbert, storied among the IVth Legion, at your service. Do you know why they call me the puppetmaster?"
11527,"Ah, but it is not for the puppets to know wherefore the hand pulls their strings. They are only to move at its command."
11528,What?
11529,An imperial soldier!?
11530,You'd be a fool to fight us. 'Tis plain you're outnumbered!
11531,"Lay down your arms, and we can end this without bloodshed!"
11532,What is he blathering on about?
11533,"I wield but a fragment of a relic wrested from the earth of Dalmasca. Even so, thanks to my ingenious experimentation, I believe you can agree that to behold its power is quite life altering!"
11534,"We have what we came for! Well done, all of you!"
11535,We've dealt the IVth a great blow!
11536,This ceruleum will keep us for a long while!
11537,Not what I was expecting...
11538,"With me, brothers! Chaaarge!"
11539,Take as much ceruleum as possible!
11540,For...Garlemald...
11541,Crush...the savages...
11542,This is where we make our stand!
11543,Hold the line!
11544,Fssssssha!
11545,Repel the invaders!
11546,"United, unified, together!"
11547,"We shall triumph, prevail, win!"
11548,No match for usss!
11549,"Forward, sssisters!"
11550,Fortune favors the brave!
11551,"Strike swiftly, strike true!"
11552,It's going to explode! Run for your lives!
11553,"Hey, where are you going!?"
11554,Wait for meeeeee!
11555,Brrrrrrrrrrrr...
11556,"What's this? A real challenge? Very well, there is no threat that more puppets cannot answer."
11557,"Allow the aether to flow through your veins, and offer up your very bodies to the safety of your master!"
11558,Nothing's getting through!
11559,It's a damn magic shield!
11560,Grrr! IGNORE! Ungh!
11561,"Excellent idea, Kosyu! We must focus on the surrounding fiends before aught else!"
11562,"Oh, my beautiful puppets. You are lovely even in your demise."
11563,But this is not <hex:021A020203>my<hex:021A020103> end. I have such grand designs yet in store... Hehehe! Hah hah haha!
11564,"We may have staved off their assault, but the head of the snake yet lives. The puppetmaster, he called himself..."
11565,Grrr! KILL! Grrr...
11566,"He says we must kill him next time, or the blood of his victims will be on our hands. I do not disagree."
11567,Heehee! What a fabulous performance! The Resistance is crushed under the unyielding boots of my puppets!
11568,"However, there is yet more my talents can achieve. The world waits with bated breath for my magnum opus, and I must not disappoint!"
11569,Ugh... We didn't stand a chance. Where did that puppetmaster come from?
11570,Grrr! KILL! Grrr...
11571,"He says we must kill him next time, or the blood of his victims will be on our hands. I do not disagree."
11572,"The fiends come, but fear not! Thracie stands with you!"
11573,"Just look at that! So pretty they are, and so frosty─icy, freezy, frosty!"
11574,"On my honor as an adventurer, I will quell this icy menace!"
11575,You beasts won't stop us from celebrating the season!
11576,Haaaaaagh! Here I goooooo!
11577,"Don't hurt yourself out there, Brother!"
11578,Look at them fight!
11579,Knock those Bombards out of the sky!
11580,You can do it!
11581,"Well, if it isn't Llofii! So kind of you to come all this way to take part in my research..."
11582,"Fabineau! Plotting another sick experiment, I see. Well, it ends today!"
11583,Test subject secured. Let the experiment begin...
11584,"We will begin with the summoning ritual. Of course, this will require a suitable sacrifice..."
11585,You...you monster!
11586,"In serving my research, their deaths will serve a greater purpose than their pathetic lives ever could!"
11587,
11588,How many innocent creatures must die to serve your crazed thirst for forbidden knowledge!?
11589,
11590,"Such a noble beast... Look how it fears not death... Now, shall we begin?"
11591,Kweh...? Kweh!
11592,They...they're only babies! Stop it!
11593,"Aether charge confirmed...precisely according to my hypothesis. Yes, these results should bear fruit..."
11594,Have you no respect for life whatsoever!?
11595,"If you disapprove, why not stop me with your own magic? Of course, that, too, is born from sacrifice..."
11596,
11597,This cannot be! My magicks...are all powerful! My research...must go on...!
11598,Master Fabineau has fallen!?
11599,Fall back to the encampment!
11600,Retreat! Retreat!
11601,At long last... Fabineau will conduct his cruel experiments no more.
11602,And yet...no doubt many innocent creatures remain trapped in his research facility.
11603,I must not rest until all are saved from a horrific fate...
11604,No...! I cannot...fall...here...
11605,Turn tail and run back to your precious Resistance... And tell them Fabineau has made another breakthrough!
11606,
11607,
11608,
11609,
11610,It's no use... Fabineau's magicks are too powerful...
11611,"I am Pagaga, queen of beasts! Show yourself, Resistance worms!"
11612,Grrr...! Ungggh... Graaagh!
11613,"“The girl...she seems different than before,” you say? We had best be wary, then..."
11614,"At any rate, it would seem we've been issued a challenge. It wouldn't do for us to turn tail now."
11615,"Well, if it isn't the spear girl and the mustachioed muscle-head. This time, you'll pay for dishonoring Father!"
11616,On the Vochstein name...I swear I will not fall!
11617,The “Beast King”? Hah! I'll show Lyon who truly deserves to wear the crown!
11618,The Vochsteins are the true rulers of beastkind─now and forever!
11619,"Berda, Obda! I told you to stay put! Your wounds are not yet healed..."
11620,Screech!
11621,
11622,Screech! Screeeeeech!
11623,"Berda, how sweet you are! Obda, let us fight as one to the end!"
11624,Screeeeeech!
11625,They're tougher than they look. No wonder Lyon felt he'd met his match...
11626,But this Vochstein will not bend so easily!
11627,"Next time! Next time, I swear─Pagaga will <hex:021A020203>end you<hex:021A020103>!"
11628,"She's a persistent one, isn't she...?"
11629,Ungh... Unghhha!
11630,"“Big words, but those wounds will keep her from the front lines for some time,” you say? We can only hope so..."
11631,"Friend or foe, I've no desire to see a girl throw her life away for foolish pride."
11632,Behold! <hex:021A020203>This<hex:021A020103> is what it means to rule beastkind! <hex:021A020203>This<hex:021A020103> is the power of the Vochsteins!
11633,Screeeeeech!
11634,Gahaha! I can see Lyon's face. The self-styled Beast King is but a weanling compared to the power of Pagaga!
11635,
11636,
11637,Our foe is too stubborn today. Let us retreat and regroup while we have the chance...
11638,
11639,I won't fall so easily!
11640,Nor I!
11641,Ba Go's heart bursts with excitement!
11642,"Go boom for Ba Go, my beauties!"
11643,Take that!
11644,Yah! Eee-yah!
11645,"You can do it, Brother!"
11646,<pant> <huff> The battle...is won!
11647,"Did you see me out there, Sister?"
11648,Ba Go's icy pretties! How beautifully you go boom...
11649,Victory is ours!
11650,Phew...what a relief!
11651,"Oh, Brother, you were amazing out there!"
11652,No Bombard will pass!
11653,Now <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103> was a fight!
11654,"Thank you, my friends!"
11655,Is this where I fall...?
11656,Majha! Forgive your brother's failure...
11657,Ba Go is no match for your beautiful booms...
11658,Urgh...
11659,Th-They're too strong!
11660,Brother! Come back to us! Brother!
11661,Are we all going to freeze to death?
11662,Flee! Flee for your lives!
11663,"Today, victory shall be ours! For Bozja!"
11664,The Blades shall be our banner!
11665,Bozjans are more than just warriors. Our strength is your strength!
11666,In the name of justice!
11667,"I shall not fall, so that my allies may see the morrow!"
11668,Allow me to be your shield! Stay close!
11669,Hah!
11670,Masterful ninjutsu takes on many forms!
11671,Your technique is atrocious.
11672,Now!
11673,Hyah!
11674,Gaaah!
11675,One more scar!
11676,Don't make this easy!
11677,This is how we fight in Nagxia!
11678,Grrr!
11679,Grrraaah!
11680,Gruooohhh!
11681,We will never surrender!
11682,I am Gunnhildr's blade!
11683,The twin facets of mana are at my beck and call!
11684,I shall forge a path of my own making!
11685,I don't think so!
11686,Bask in divine light!
11687,For Bozja!
11688,We shall reclaim our home!
11689,We shall wrest freedom from the clutches of tyrants!
11690,Our oppressors shall pay for their sins!
11691,Go! Push them back!
11692,Follow the Blades!
11693,You shall not pass!
11694,Haaah!
11695,Witness the strength of Bozja!
11696,Today we pave the way to freedom!
11697,Now you know what we're made of!
11698,The imperial army will crumble before us!
11699,For the liberation!
11700,The full might of the Empire is helpless before us!
11701,We've lost! Retreat!
11702,The Garleans are too strong!
11703,Curses... We must retreat!
11704,Gaaah! We can go on no longer!
11705,The shame of defeat is bitter indeed...
11706,Fall back! Fall back!
11707,Not now... Not here...
11708,Ugh... Where did we go wrong?
11709,Uuugh...
11710,No...I can still...fight...
11711,I was careless...
11712,Is this...where I meet my end?
11713,Ugh... Aaagh...
11714,I've shamed myself...
11715,No... Victory was all but guaranteed...
11716,Such trifling wounds...shouldn't stop me...
11717,Ngh...
11718,Ahhh!
11719,Are we doomed...to be ruled?
11720,I was foolish to think I was ready...
11721,I can't...save anyone...
11722,I'm sorry... I've failed you...
11723,Move those tail feathers!
11724,Careful of that rooster!
11725,Quick! Grab that one!
11726,Try not to lose any fingers!
11727,"Blade <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0303>, over here!"
11728,Bring the components to me!
11729,Now is the moment to strike.
11730,"I stand ready, Master."
11731,"Let us go, Tsubame!"
11732,Understood!
11733,Ugh... I was careless...
11734,Confound it...
11735,"Mission accomplished! Well done, everyone!"
11736,This bodes ill... We must retreat!
11737,My thanks for your aid.
11738,Victory is ours!
11739,Grah hah! TRAPPED! Grahaha!
11740,What!? More reinforcements!?
11741,Is this where we meet our fate?
11742,"Heh heh heh... You seem to be hard-pressed, my dear Yamatsumi."
11743,Your escape has been cut off. You're trapped.
11744,
11745,"But worry not, for your salvation has arrived. Speak your heart's most earnest wish to the relic I bear, and the path to it shall open."
11746,"Please, Dabog! Come back with us!"
11747,<bzzzt> Fools. The thing that stands before you is not Dabog.
11748,I...I have only one wish: to see the onmyoji revived under the flag of a new nation!
11749,Huh? There's a voice...a voice coming from the stone. I can... I─ Ungaaah! GWAAAH!!!
11750,"No, it is an organic component─one designed to extract the most out of our weaponry!"
11751,Hahaha! Haaahaha! Your wish is the relic's command!
11752,"You live now under my flag, puppets to obey my every command! You shall be revived, oh yes, and more majestically than you have ever dreamed!"
11753,He's using Yamatsumi as fodder for his summoning!
11754,Grrrgh. Evil! Urrrgh!
11755,"One evil deed after another, he says. This man seems partial to them."
11756,The onmyoji...shall return...
11757,For Lord Noah... To birth his nation...
11758,"Hahaha. A defeat, perhaps, but a fruitful one. I have seen the measure of the relic's strength, and I am not left wanting."
11759,Wh-Who are these men!? Why do they all look like Dabog!?
11760,
11761,"If Yamatsumi can make such a puissant puppet, what power would the master himself produce?"
11762,Grrr. Pity. Urgh.
11763,"He has pity for Yamatsumi. I see why... They were given their wish, albeit a warped and twisted version of it."
11764,"A cruel fate, even for one so misguided. Such terrifying power should not be in the hands of one so depraved."
11765,We must take every measure to stop him. Muster every last onze of our strength.
11766,
11767,
11768,"Mwahaha! The relic is splendid, absolutely splendid!"
11769,We're outmatched! We must retreat and regroup!
11770,How shameful...
11771,Grrr! PATIENCE! Graaah!
11772,"Yes, Kosyu. Now is the time for patience. We can fight another day."
11773,I fight in the name of the Vochsteins! My head would make a worthy prize─not that any of you cowards could take it!
11774,We are under attack! Repeat: we are under attack! Requesting air support!
11775,"Isn't it obvious? We have succeeded in mass-producing them.<hex:02100103>Go forth, my enhanced soldiers! Go forth and destroy the enemy!"
11776,"Damn it, they're too strong! Fall back! Fall back!"
11777,The Resistance is withdrawing! Repeat: the Resistance is withdrawing! Much obliged for the air support!
11778,Wh-What is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
11779,"Whatever it is, I've never seen one so big!"
11780,I-It comes! Steel yourself!
11781,GrOAaARrRGgGH!
11782,"Oho, we meet again, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>! Still fighting up a storm, I hear. You really ought to join us. I'd see to it you want for nothing."
11783,"But I know a lost cause when I see one, and you can make a man beg only so many times."
11784,"Not good... It pains to say this, but we must retreat!"
11785,"Finally given up on trying to woo our friend, has he?"
11786,"So, with that out of the way, let's get right to business... You're all chocobo fodder!"
11787,Kweeeh!
11788,We'll see about that!
11789,"Gahahaha, there's nothing like a good rampage!"
11790,"No hard feelings, eh? At the end of the day, I just need the coin to feed my own."
11791,Kweeeh!
11792,Such touching concern for his underlings...
11793,"Godsdammit... Sorry, but I can't afford to die here. Someone needs to put meat and mead on the table, see?"
11794,"We'll settle this another time, I promise! So long!"
11795,Kweh... Kweh...
11796,"Quite a character, this Daguza..."
11797,"Gahahaha! Victory belongs to the strong, and we're the strongest of all!"
11798,"If you have a change of heart, just let me know, eh? We can never have too many strong people like you!"
11799,Kweh! Kweh!
11800,Hrrrgh! Hrrrk!
11801,Excellent. Let us return to the <hex:021A020203>Dalriada<hex:021A020103>.
11802,We should be getting back.
11803,Back to the <hex:021A020203>Dalriada<hex:021A020103>. Our next mission awaits!
11804,Hrrrk! Hrrrngh!
11805,"Hah hah! You may think to find comfort in numbers, but they shall all be my puppets!"
11806,"You there! You appear to be Far Easterners, but you're not one of us. Identify yourselves!"
11807,"We are the Onmyoji Brotherhood, and fate has ordained that we serve Lord Noah. In his name we shall strike you down."
11808,"Hmph, I bloody knew it... To arms! To arms!"
11809,GrOAaARrRGgGH!
11810,Our comrades need help! Look alive!
11811,"Reinforcements so soon? Very well, allow us to return the favor.<hex:02100103>O shikigami! I bid you smite my foes!"
11812,Wh-What is that abomination? Have care!
11813,Ugh... It seems I underestimated them...
11814,That my shikigami should be defeated...
11815,"And here come the roosters! Keep your distance, or you'll soon wish you had!"
11816,"Hmph, you may have won the day, but this isn't over. Far from it."
11817,"The enemy is fled! Well fought, brothers!"
11818,Yaaah!
11819,Know the power of the Onmyoji Brotherhood!
11820,Their sorcery is more formidable than I had reckoned... Retreat! Retreat!
11821,How could we lose to the likes of them!?
11822,"Remember this victory well, my brothers. For it is the moment we began carving our place in Lord Noah's new nation!"
11823,Huzzah!
11824,"The relic takes hold of your body, and I take a hold of your mind. Ere long, the strings have you bound. "
11825,"Now dance for me, puppets. Dance, and bring more to my merry troupe!"
11826,Hah hah hah! Heheee hehe!
11827,He's lost his mind...
11828,Gwaaah! Aaargh!
11829,My...my body...! It's burning... It's buuurning!
11830,<hex:021A020203>This<hex:021A020103> is the uncouth rabble our glorious legion has struggled so long to eliminate...? How disheartening.
11831,"No matter. I am here now, and I shall sweep this field clean of Resistance filth!"
11832,Fabineau!? How did─?<hex:02100103>Why are you in Bozja?
11833,"Llofii, my dear! The reports had you pinned as a deserter.<hex:02100103>Have you come forth to surrender to me, then? To beg my forgiveness?"
11834,Never! I will never again align myself with you and your cruel experiments!
11835,It falls to me to cleanse the stain of your betrayal!
11836,You will suffer for the suffering you've inflicted!
11837,"Ah, but where are my manners?<hex:02100103>You really should meet your successor."
11838,"I'm sure the two of you will get along splendidly─after all, you do have so much in common!"
11839,"Allow me to introduce a fellow traitor: Lovro, of Gunnhildr's Blades!"
11840,In the name of the queen...<hex:02100103>All dissidents must perish!
11841,No...<hex:02100103>This man has been tempered...
11842,"My poor, addled Llofii.<hex:02100103>Our final farewell is at hand."
11843,My queen...<hex:02100103>I return to your side...
11844,"Fabineau was not content to meddle with the monoceros, it seems.<hex:02100103>He has expanded into other foul spheres of experimentation..."
11845,I care not what it costs me─I must put an end to his evil!
11846,My queen!<hex:02100103>I bring you victory!
11847,That is true power.<hex:02100103>Remember well this defeat.
11848,Run...<hex:02100103>We have to run!
11849,Who goes there!?
11850,I am her shield. I am her sword. The queen's blade is all that I am or wish to be!
11851,"Lovro! I had not wanted to believe the reports, but now I see that they spoke true..."
11852,"Though it pains me to stand against you, my duty is clear!"
11853,It is fitting somehow...<hex:02100103>The techniques that you once taught me shall be the very same I wield to effect your capture!
11854,"Mine own red magicks, used against me by an enemy of the queen!"
11855,Yet I wonder...have you mastered <hex:021A020203>all<hex:021A020103> my secrets?<hex:02100103>Dare you unleash the fires of the Crimson Scourge!?
11856,No... I've felt this surge of mana before...<hex:02100103>Back! Everyone back!
11857,Gods above!<hex:02100103>The tempering has only enhanced his powers...
11858,I cannot fall here.<hex:02100103>My queen yet has need of me...
11859,"Lovro, please! We can help─!"
11860,"For a kindness, at least his body yet remains uncorrupted.<hex:02100103>We can still... There is still time."
11861,"Fear not, my mentor.<hex:02100103>We will save you from this darkness..."
11862,Fall back! His magicks are too strong!<hex:02100103>We must regroup and reconsider our strategy!
11863,My queen! This victory I seize in your name!<hex:02100103>Your Majesty's loyal servant returns...
11864,Mark you the weapon he wields?<hex:02100103>That man is Lovro─one of Gunnhildr's Blades!
11865,"You dare face me again, foul pretender to the red mantle!?"
11866,"Aye, and this time, I will not fail."
11867,"I will honor you, my mentor...by subduing you in battle!"
11868,Foe to my queen.<hex:02100103>Prepare to meet your end!
11869,Ugh! ...You truly are a master of the art!<hex:02100103>Yet I will prove myself the stronger!
11870,"I tire of this contest!<hex:02100103>If you seek my best, then you shall have it!"
11871,And I will weather the storm just as you taught me...with heart and steel!
11872,My vital flame─
11873,My vital flame feeds the Crimson Scourge!
11874,My spell!?<hex:02100103>How dare you─?
11875,My aether... How feeble grows its fire...
11876,"Quickly, bind him while he is still weak!"
11877,"<pant> <pant> <pant><hex:02100103>It is done, Master Lovro. The healing can begin!"
11878,I have...no more aether to give...and yet he still stands!
11879,"Victory, my queen!<hex:02100103>I return to you triumphant!"
11880,"If you wish to participate in these light-hearted games, please gather at Bright Ballad's Passage."
11881,Artisans of all persuasions can join in the fun and win fabulous prizes!
11882,We eagerly look forward to your participation!
11883,"This is the final call for fêtes! If you wish to participate, please hasten to Bright Ballad's Passage."
11884,"Come, friends, pray do not dally!"
11885,"Follow our mascots to the Mattock, where the fête “Made of Softer Stuff” will be held."
11886,The fun and excitement have only just begun!
11887,"In charge of this fête is Chirpy Chocobo, who loves all things fluffy and downy."
11888,Our mascots are making their way to the venue as we speak.
11889,If you wish to participate─and surely you do─please follow them to Bright Ballad's Passage!
11890,"Quickly, now. As the saying goes, “Good things come to those who <hex:021A020203>don't<hex:021A020103> wait”!"
11891,"This time, Perky Piggy and his lovable litter of swinelings will be in charge of the proceedings."
11892,"Including the soon-to-commence “Toy Hunter,” but two fêtes remain."
11893,"There, the fifth and final fête awaits: “Presents of Mind.”"
11894,"This being the rousing conclusion, we hope to see every one of you there with bells on!"
11895,"And that concludes all the fêtes. On behalf of all the residents of the Firmament, we thank you for joining us in the revelry."
11896,The Skyrise Celebration is our way of honoring our esteemed builders while welcoming folk from near and far to our new home.
11897,"We hope that we have been able to give back some of the joy we have received, and wish you much and more happiness!"
11898,"Bajsaljen, sir!<hex:02100103>There's someone there!"
11899,Who would be wandering a battlefield alone...?
11900,"You appear to be Bozjan, sir, but how came you to this place?"
11901,"...Dabog? It is you, is it not?<hex:02100103>There were reports of your capture two years ago!"
11902,This is hyperpilot Dabog.<hex:02100103>Hostile forces confirmed. Initiating combat.
11903,"Wait, we know this man!"
11904,I recognize that warmachina!<hex:02100103>...And now we know who the pilot was.
11905,"Dabog is not in his right mind, but he leaves us little choice.<hex:02100103>Defend yourselves!"
11906,"Fight their control, Dabog!<hex:02100103>This is not who you are!"
11907,Energy levels dropping. Initiating subroutines.<hex:02100103>Launching alternative attack patterns.
11908,"Dabog!<hex:02100103>Gods, that machina is a menace!"
11909,"Careful, sir!"
11910,This is hyperpilot Dabog.<hex:02100103>Hull integrity compromised. Retreating to base.
11911,"Dabog, wait! Let us help you!"
11912,Is tempering not abhorrent enough!? Must they seek out new ways to twist and control men's hearts!?
11913,"It lies beyond all reason, sir..."
11914,"Then we must work doubly hard not to lose our own. We stay the course, and hope it also leads to his salvation..."
11915,This is hyperpilot Dabog.<hex:02100103>Hostiles routed. Returning to base.
11916,So this is where those Resistance rats were hiding...
11917,Heh. Nothing escapes our eyes...
11918,0
11919,Imperial scouts...?
11920,"If they relay this information to their superiors, we're done for! Kill them all!"
11921,"I, too, am a blade of Gunnhildr...and I will do my master proud!"
11922,We're under attack! Request aerial support at once!
11923,Fire at will! Reduce them to ashes!
11924,M-Master...did you see that!? Your student has done you proud!
11925,"So you are one of Gunnhildr's Blades, yes? Thank you for kindly volunteering this information."
11926,"Hah! Spying from the comfort of magitek armor, I see. Next time, we cross blades on the battlefield!"
11927,"Our attacks barely scathe them. Oh, Master, whatever shall I do!?"
11928,"R-Right... We must live to fight another day. Retreat! Retreat, I say!"
11929,A-Aye!
11930,"Curses, there are too many..."
11931,Allow us to even the odds!
11932,You couldn't have picked a better moment!
11933,We stand with you!
11934,Down with the IVth!
11935,Let's do this!
11936,We will prevail!
11937,I have your backs!
11938,"Thank you, my friends! Let us put an end to the Empire's villainy!"
11939,We will send him to Gangos!
11940,The fête “Made of Softer Stuff” is currently underway on the Mattock.
11941,Don't miss this chance to craft adorably large stuffed toys!
11942,
11943,
11944,"Hurry, friends! Time is almost up!"
11945,The fête “Made of Softer Stuff” will soon conclude.
11946,"If you still have a toy, please hurry and deliver it to the wain!"
11947,"To assist us in distributing rewards, please remain in your artisan's attire until you have received yours."
11948,Be on your guard.<hex:02100103>I will speak with this lost lamb.
11949,"The fête “Shear-a-Yak” is currently being held at Bright Ballad's Passage. Join us in the fun and reap─or should I say, <hex:021A020203>shear<hex:021A020103>─the rewards!"
11950,I trust your clippers are firing well─our mascots are meticulous with their maintenance!
11951,"Lest you worry for your safety, I assure you our wooly friend has been rendered docile with a feast of his favorite fodder."
11952,The fête “Shear-a-Yak” will soon conclude.
11953,"If you still have fleece, please hurry and deliver it to Chirpy Chocobo!"
11954,"To assist us in distributing rewards, please remain in your artisan's attire until you have received yours."
11955,"The fête “Toy Hunter” is underway on the Abacus. Seek and you will find, participate and you will receive─prizes, that is!"
11956,"The rules are simple: open the right present box to find the lucky toy, and see it to Perky Piggy's hands."
11957,The fête “Toy Hunter” is underway on the Abacus. It isn't too late to participate and receive prizes!
11958,"If you find yourself turned into a cute little piggy, fret not. The magick swiftly wears off."
11959,The hunt is drawing to a close. How many lucky toys have you found thus far?
11960,The fête “Toy Hunter” will soon conclude.
11961,"Loath though I am to disappoint, you can't take the lucky toys home with you. Please deliver them to Perky Piggy."
11962,"To assist us in distributing rewards, please remain in your artisan's attire until you have received yours."
11963,The fête “Presents of Mind” is currently taking place on the Mattock.
11964,"Take the presents the mascots have prepared, and see them delivered to the right people!"
11965,The fête “Presents of Mind” is currently taking place on the Mattock.
11966,"Such delight writ upon the faces of the recipients! Come, let's keep up the gift giving!"
11967,"Hurry, friends! Not long now until the gift giving must come to an end!"
11968,The fête “Presents of Mind” will soon conclude.
11969,"Time is almost up, friends. Please deliver your last presents."
11970,"As today's excitement draws to a close, may we say what wonderful participants you have all been!"
11971,"If none of them are Dabog, what have you done with him!?"
11972,"Ah yes, subject VIII. He was a truly exceptional prototype."
11973,"Alas, his flesh eventually succumbed to the rigors of testing. Controlling such complex machinery takes a heavy toll, you see."
11974,"Fortunately, we were able to overcome this problem by means of the VIIth's data extraction technique."
11975,"From his combat expertise to his memories, we transferred everything into these enhanced soldiers. "
11976,What!? You heartless fiend! Does your depravity know no bounds!?
11977,You will pay for this! We will avenge Dabog!
11978,Impossible... That my enhanced unit should be wiped out...
11979,"So be it. I had intended to conduct more tests, but you leave me no choice. Savor your victory while you still can!"
11980,It sounds as though he hasn't shown all of his hand yet...
11981,"Well, whatever it is he has coming, we'll be ready to fight!"
11982,"Indeed. We will fight, and we will triumph─for Dabog and everyone we have lost."
11983,"Come, my friends. Let us return to the encampment and prepare for the next battle."
11984,"Ugh, we cannot contend with such firepower... Fall back! Fall back!"
11985,Damn you!
11986,If only I were stronger...
11987,We must retreat while we can!
11988,"Urabe-no-Yamatsumi, you thief! Marsak told us where to find you!"
11989,What madness has possessed you to abscond with Doma's treasure? To lick the boots of the Empire!?
11990,"Thieves? Do you forget your roots, shinobi of Doma? You deserve no explanation, but for the motherland we share, you shall have it."
11991,"The priests endured untold suffering under Yotsuyu's iron rule, her ire toward our traditions often turning to wrath."
11992,Only by Legatus Noah's grace did we survive those dark times. Delivering this treasure to him is the least we can do to repay his clandestine efforts to aid us.
11993,And in repaying your debt you would stifle the Bozjans? Think about the full reach of your actions!
11994,0
11995,0
11996,Gah... The spirit is willing...but the flesh is bruised and battered...
11997,The tenma has fallen!?
11998,"It is not too late for you, Yamatsumi! We can still return to Doma together! We can return home together!"
11999,0
12000,I swore my life to Legatus Noah! Behold the depth of my loyalty!
12001,Wait!
12002,What a waste...
12003,Curses! We're letting them escape!
12004,We cannot win this battle! Tsubame!
12005,Fall back!
12006,Retreat! Retreat!
12007,"Remember this defeat well, shinobi. As brothers and sisters of Doma, we showed mercy this time. We will not do so again."
12008,You are...much changed. What have those fiends done to you!?
12009,"Remember that, Resistance scum!"
12010,Victory is at hand!
12011,Witness the strength of the IVth Legion!
12012,Victory and glory are ours! Inform command!
12013,Gah... Bloody bastards...
12014,Fall back!
12015,Ugh... We cannot...submit.
12016,No. Defeat is impossible!
12017,"I am Pagaga of House Vochstein, queen of all beastkind! Cower before me!"
12018,Grrrghhh! Voch...stein...? Grahahaha!
12019,"“The Vochsteins are renowned in the West for their beast-taming prowess,” you say? You know this girl?"
12020,"Ahahaha! Father's exploits are sung of far and wide! Should you wish to flee, now is your chance!"
12021,"The girl has skill befitting one of Lyon's students, I'll give her that."
12022,"Grrrgh... Lyon? Rival, gah... Hrargh!"
12023,"“The Vochsteins have long been Lyon's rivals for the title of Beast King,” you say? I say, old friend, where do you learn these things?"
12024,"<hex:021A020203>Rivals<hex:021A020103>, you say!? Hah! That weanling Lyon is not fit to wear Father's skivvies!"
12025,You sully the name of House Vochstein...and you shall pay for this dishonor with your lives!
12026,No... What have you done to my beauties!?
12027,"Pagaga will remember this day. The next time we meet, my beauties will drink of your blood!"
12028,"Lyon has quite the reputation, but it seems he's not the only one with these skills..."
12029,Guhurggh... Back. Ungh!
12030,"Indeed. We had best return, restock, and report our findings."
12031,
12032,Curses! These damn beasts are too strong for us! Fall back! We'll take our chances another day!
12033,"Gahaha! This is the strength of House Vochstein, rulers of all beastkind!"
12034,Who needs that greybeard Lyon!? Pagaga and her beauties will smite the Resistance single-handedly!
12035,Hull integrity at 60%. Firepower insufficient.<hex:02100103>Requesting helldiver reinforcements.
12036,"Sir, we have movement.<hex:02100103>Magitek armor inbound!"
12037,0
12038,We must be ready for every eventuality!
12039,We must have faith in Arenvald and Fordola!
12040,The seat of the Amalj'aa's power doth lie beyond this valley...
12041,We must be ready for every eventuality!
12042,We must have faith in Arenvald and Fordola!
12043,The way forward is clear!
12044,"Good work, as always!"
12045,The kobolds have proven to be staunch allies indeed!
12046,Most impressive...
12047,"Good work, as always!"
12048,The kobolds have proven to be staunch allies indeed!
12049,A Meracydian dragon...
12050,I think this answers the question of how they summoned Bahamut...
12051,"It's fast, but not fast enough!"
12052,A Meracydian dragon...
12053,I think this answers the question of how they summoned Bahamut...
12054,"In death, may you find the peace you were denied in life..."
12055,Let us make haste.
12056,The Amalj'aa need all the help they can get. Come on!
12057,"In death, may you find the peace you were denied in life..."
12058,We must proceed with caution if we wish to slip through the enemy's front line.
12059,"With Estinien and Tiamat on our side, we have nothing to fear!"
12060,Estinien! Leave these foes to us!
12061,Let us follow Tiamat and Ser Estinien's lead!
12062,Estinien! Leave these foes to us!
12063,One could not ask for more dependable allies!
12064,The armies of the Alliance have entered the fray.
12065,Let's lend the Ishgardians our support!
12066,Lord Aymeric! And Lucia!
12067,Our presence is yet required in the city.
12068,Lord Aymeric! And Lucia!
12069,The armies of the Alliance have entered the fray.
12070,There is no time to lose.<hex:02100103>To the valley!
12071,"Together, we will force the enemy back!"
12072,It seems Estinien is good for something after all.
12073,It seems Estinien is good for something after all.
12074,As you should well know!<hex:02100103>Or have you been ignoring my tales of his exploits?
12075,"Another of the Empire's magitek monstrosities, it would seem."

12082,The Amalj'aa could teach<hex:02100103>me a thing or two about pyromancy.

12117,Why...? Why am I here...down in the dirt?
12118,I will see you all ground into meat slop!
12119,Your minced remains will fill the feeding troughs of my menagerie!
12120,"Do not give chase! You only risk being ambushed.<hex:02100103>See to the wounded, and keep watch for approaching enemies."
12121,"I must say, this Clarricie is proving to be a problem.<hex:02100103>Where does she keep finding all these fantastic beasts?"
12122,"A mystery for another day, perhaps.<hex:02100103>Come, let us make our way back to camp..."
12123,"You useless, spineless worms.<hex:02100103>Lyuba must have more exercise than that!"
12124,We cannot risk any more casualties.<hex:02100103>Gather the wounded and quit the field!
12125,Retreat!

12128,I...I can't move!
12129,"Stop squirming, you savage!"
12130,Resistance fighters? What's going on here!?
12131,"He's calling in fire support, but this is no time to withdraw!<hex:02100103>We stand our ground!"

12136,Everyone ready?<hex:02100103>Then let's not dally any longer!

12158,This...this is hyperpilot Dabog.<hex:02100103>Order acknowledged. Deploying long-range assault nodes.
12159,I-It's a trap!
12160,We're surrounded!

12503,We must be patient!
12504,The brute's far from bright...
12505,Does he even know friend from foe?
12506,"If we <hex:021A020203>must<hex:021A020103> fight, can we get on with it?"
12507,Slow of wit yet heavy of hand...
12508,...
12509,Can we not just walk past it?
12510,What am I watching?
12511,It's...some manner of primal.
12512,This is an abomination.<hex:02100103>A perversion of people's faith!
12513,"Whatever this being is, we can't let it stand in our way!"
12514,Just another foe to vanquish.
12515,My sentiments exactly.
12516,"Well, that victory felt...insubstantial."
12517,Onwards to the upper floors!
12518,"We can't very well stay here, can we?"
12519,That was tiresome.
12520,"You fought well, Alisaie."
12521,I was in good company.
12522,It's like being in the belly of a beast...
12523,"What is it made of, I wonder?"
12524,How are we to rescue everyone?
12525,This place sets my teeth on edge.
12526,Best not to think on it for now.
12527,They've been awfully busy taking prisoners...
12528,We must find the heart of this tower...and shut it down.
12529,I wonder how Y'shtola and the others fare.
12530,What manner of creature are these things?
12531,"Aye, whatever it takes."
12532,Just like in the picture...<hex:02100103>We're facing the Magus Sisters!
12533,A mockery of the Thavnairian gods!
12534,She bars our path.<hex:02100103>That's all we need to know.
12535,"So it's to be lance against lance, is it?"
12536,"The same sisters the fisher lad told us about, yes?"
12537,"Just a pale imitation of divinity, in the end."
12538,Shall we push on?
12539,What else can this tower throw at us?
12540,Someone needed more training with the spear...
12541,"Protective of the tower, aren't they?"
12542,"Compelled by Telophoroi magicks, I imagine."
12543,I believe we've reached the summit.
12544,The corruption...it feels stronger here.
12545,The aether here is thick as syrup...
12546,The talisman...<hex:02100103>I feel it trembling.
12547,"Aye, the talisman trembles to resist it."
12548,More warmachina to dismantle...
12549,Just a little further!
12550,"Ugh, we're so close, and now this!"
12551,"Rattling, clunking nuisances..."
12552,Stay focused! Now is not the time for mistakes!
12553,"The third and final sister, I hope?"
12554,I suppose we should have expected a third sister...
12555,Cast down this false goddess and let us be done with it!
12556,Would have been quicker to fight all three at once...
12557,"Alphinaud, get back!"
12558,Please don't tempt fate like that.
12559,Wonderful.<hex:02100103>I do so love guessing games.
12560,Illusory magicks?
12561,"What─!?<hex:02100103>Ugh, spare me..."
12562,The pixies subjected me to far worse...
12563,My eyes are not so easily deceived.
12564,A childish trick...but undeniably effective.
12565,What nonsense is this?
12566,It seems he is determined to protect Meteion.
12567,Aye. A right bother this is going to be...
12568,Let us make our way through the Frozen Sphere.
12569,"Ugh, of course there's a cold zone, and of course we're going through it..."
12570,Would that we didn't have to put down the creations...
12571,"Oh dear, this fellow seems disinclined to let us pass..."
12572,Then we have no choice but to force our way.
12573,May you find peace in the aetherial sea...
12574,"Come, we mustn't tarry."
12575,I'm afraid we can't do that.
12576,Warn us all you like. We're coming regardless.
12577,At least he has the courtesy to warn us.
12578,"He may have his flaws, but you can't fault his managerial prowess."
12579,Seriously? You want to discuss his candidacy <hex:021A020203>now<hex:021A020103>?
12580,Goodness me... What manner of thinking is behind this?
12581,There truly is no accounting for taste...
12582,"A pass for constitution, but a fail for intelligence."
12583,"If its concept is submitted, I will be certain to reject it."
12584,We're close. I can hear it in his voice.
12585,We're taking Meteion! Whether you like it or not!
12586,"He's not going to give up, is he?"
12587,"Enough is enough, Hermes!"
12588,"Stubbornness can be a virtue, but this is a little excessive."
12589,"To protect Meteion, he would go so far as to transform..."
12590,So far as to make himself a villain...
12591,A staff...
12592,Footprints?
12593,Did it flee?
12594,"No, it's still near!"
12595,There!
12596,This wouldn't fool a child.
12597,Hide shouldst thou wish...
12598,"But 'neath the light of the stars, all is laid bare!"
12599,"Nice try, but your aether is still showing."
12600,Is this...Vanish?
12601,"...No, it couldn't be."
12602,A pathetic trick.
12603,Yah!
12604,An impressive concealment ability.
12605,Shame about the telltale footprints.
12606,Is it seriously trying to hide? From <hex:021A020203>us<hex:021A020103>?
12607,"Oh, please..."
12608,Oh?
12609,That the power of ice could be used this way...
12610,"Alas, it's no use on us."
12611,"Vanished again... But again, it's left footprints."
12612,"If we smash everything, we're bound to hit something!"
12613,Gah! Where the hells are you!?
12614,"It's hidden itself better than before, I'll give it that."
12615,But it's still not good enough.
12616,If thou wouldst repeat thy trick...
12617,Then thou wilt not object were I to do likewise.
12618,Behold the puissance of Sharlayan astrology!
12619,"Hmph, haven't you learned anything?"
12620,If you would conceal yourself...
12621,You really must learn to cover your tracks.
12622,Let's flush it out!
12623,"A little shy, are we? Fine by me. I can wait."
12624,"Well, well, it's trying to confuse us."
12625,But we won't be so easily confounded.
12626,I've had enough of this mummer's farce.
12627,"Oho, how very creative."
12628,"I must say, this is a promising concept."
12629,I wonder whose it is...
12630,The way forward is clear.
12631,"If this is the test we must overcome, so be it. "
12632,What is She planning?
12633,Such a high concentration of aether!
12634,The elements in perfect alignment...
12635,"Whatever this is, we've but one choice."
12636,To break the circle!
12637,Exactly!
12638,The suffering we've witnessed only strengthens our resolve!
12639,"By the Light, we shall!"
12640,Brace yourselves!
12641,Ungh!
12642,Aghhh!
12643,Hmph!
12644,Aaah!
12645,It'll take...more than that!
12646,This bodes ill!
12647,Hers is the power to sunder worlds...
12648,Oof... I'll feel that one tomorrow.
12649,"We're all standing, yes?"
12650,We are indeed.
12651,For better or worse...
12652,I've got plenty of fight left in me!
12653,Aye.
12654,All accounted for!
12655,This was never like to be easy!
12656,She's got more tricks up her sleeve than G'raha!
12657,"Well, pardon me for not measuring up to the God of Light!"
12658,She's quick...but not quick enough!
12659,"Oh, here She comes!"
12660,This is it! Forward!
12661,Let me at them!
12662,"Quickly, but calmly..."
12663,The Telophoroi's reign ends this day!
12664,Never thought I'd come back...
12665,I shall bring up the rear.
12666,Prisoners! Let's get them out of there!
12667,Captives!
12668,Let us entrust them to our comrades.
12669,This is barbaric!
12670,"Here to be tempered, no doubt!"
12671,"A hypertuned soldier, perhaps?<hex:02100103>As for the other chap, who knows?"
12672,What's that supposed to be?
12673,Moenbryda's dual haken...
12674,"An engineer and his creation, I presume."
12675,A face only a mother could love...
12676,He doth not appear to have been tempered.
12677,Damn! The engineer got away!
12678,After him!
12679,Hardly seems worth chasing...
12680,Is this the best they can muster?
12681,He ran away?
12682,Going up?
12683,I feel the air rushing upwards...
12684,"So far, so good. Let's continue."
12685,"Even on the inside, this place has changed completely."
12686,Just think what it took to build this ghastly place...
12687,The perfect route...if one <hex:021A020203>enjoys<hex:021A020103> being ambushed...
12688,There must be a way to reach the upper levels...
12689,I sense danger afoot...
12690,I know that feeling... The same as the Tower of Zot.
12691,"You sense it, too, yes?"
12692,"Magitek... No, wait... That's something far worse."
12693,I sense living aether... That is no mere machine.
12694,Even the Allagans would balk at such devilry.
12695,Pathetic creature.
12696,Indeed. The aether of a living being.
12697,Was he tempered?
12698,A fitting end for one so depraved.
12699,Let us not dwell on this grim episode. Onward.
12700,He never stood a chance.
12701,I'm inclined to agree.
12702,What is this foul stench?
12703,I sense great evil...all around us.
12704,"Have care, my friends!"
12705,We're heading in the right direction.
12706,"I must say, I'm not a fan of the décor."
12707,And the aether here is positively vile.
12708,Is that... Varis?
12709,A primal...summoned by the Garleans themselves.
12710,Tempered by their own Emperor...
12711,"As I suspected, each tower contained a piece of his corpse!"
12712,The cause of so much misery...
12713,This fiend shall plague the world no longer!
12714,Steady now. We can't afford any mistakes.
12715,I can barely look at it...
12716,Every fiber of my being is in revulsion...
12717,All the horrors of Allag cannot compare...
12718,No more games. This ends here.
12719,Indeed. Let us expunge this blight once and for all!
12720,Eyes forward!
12721,"Please, try to stay calm!"
12722,What is happening to their aether!?
12723,We're here to aid you!
12724,No time to waste!
12725,I can't imagine what he must be going through...
12726,Leave the jungle to us.
12727,"Understood. This way, everyone!"
12728,A sound plan.
12729,Agreed. We head north!
12730,Damn it! Too late...
12731,There's no other way.
12732,All we can offer is a swift death.
12733,Let's get this over with...
12734,There should be a village just ahead.
12735,You shall suffer no more...
12736,Forgive us...
12737,Then let us hurry!
12738,"You do your part, and we shall do ours!"
12739,I see someone!
12740,Pray take care!
12741,Beasts in pursuit!
12742,Did none survive?
12743,"If any yet live, we must save them!"
12744,The flames roar ever fiercer!
12745,I can only pray some made it out alive...
12746,Each beast more terrible than the last...
12747,That fiend was once one of us...
12748,I don't sense any aether!
12749,No choice but to go through it.
12750,"Whoever they were, their suffering ends here."
12751,Forward!
12752,There are likely more ahead...
12753,...
12754,Unlike anything I've ever fought...
12755,All too reminiscent of the sin eaters...
12756,Keep heading north!
12757,Gods be good... The sky...
12758,The air above is thick with fiends!
12759,A starshower...
12760,Let Vrtra worry about the skies!
12761,An all-too-familiar face...
12762,The horror of Amaurot...
12763,It can't be...
12764,"Over there, yes?"
12765,Aye. The beast of Amaurot...or something worse still.
12766,What!?
12767,I could learn a thing or two from Her!
12768,So <hex:021A020203>that's<hex:021A020103> how it's done!
12769,She's relentless!
12770,"Together, we'll overcome this!"
12771,Pray leave this to me!
12772,Tupsimati!?
12773,There's no mistaking that staff.
12774,"Art thou with us still, Papalymo?"
12775,This aether... Papalymo...
12776,A soul's abiding care for companions held dear...
12777,"His will, given form."
12778,"Farewell again, my friend."
12779,Thank you. Always.
12780,Ne'er doth words suffice...
12781,"Try as you might to conceal it, you've always worried overmuch."
12782,We understand. Rest well...
12783,"Don't fret about Lyse, either─she's just fine."
12784,And here I thought we'd moved past this.
12785,Her resentment is bigger than she was...
12786,Stained by the blood of our comrades...
12787,To think this is what remains of a life...
12788,'Tis the very depravity she showed at the Waking Sands.
12789,May you be cleansed by the tide.
12790,Cling to any feeling so long and it's bound to turn dark...
12791,Release thy passions. For thine own sake.
12792,Well! That was harrowing.
12793,That is quite enough!
12794,Saving our hides once again?
12795,That's Moenbryda's!
12796,Thou ever grantest me the strength to move forward...
12797,A dual haken?
12798,She'll always be here for you.
12799,Watch where it splits. Alisaie!
12800,Way ahead of you!
12801,Let's go!
12802,Do you see that light?
12803,This is our way forward.
12804,Lord Haurchefant!
12805,That shield!
12806,The heraldry of House Fortemps...
12807,"A true knight, to thus aid a hero."
12808,The people of Ishgard won't forget you.
12809,Now keep his hope alive!
12810,"The light, it's..."
12811,
12812,
12813,
12814,
12815,
12816,
12817,"Still holding to his principles in a way, I suppose."
12818,"Gaius no longer wishes this of you, Praefectus!"
12819,Regret for a duty unfulfilled...
12820,Clinging to his orders even beyond death?
12821,Maybe another sound thumping will convince him to let go.
12822,Rest. Your fight is over.
12823,You didn't fail him...
12824,"Return now to the star, that thy loyalty might serve better ends..."
12825,Lay down your arms...
12826,That was but a shade. I'm sure the true Rhitahtyn has moved on.
12827,This Light! Is it truly─
12828,"Look, the Crystal!"
12829,It has to be...
12830,We knew you'd come.
12831,Such a warm glow...
12832,Indeed. It's her.
12833,Showing us the way...once more.
12834,Our Antecedent.
12835,The truth lieth ahead.
12836,I knew we would meet here.
12837,I am truly honored.
12838,She always was our lodestar.
12839,Minfilia! I...
12840,We'll make you proud.
12841,Art thou content?
12842,"Our thanks, Minfilia, for being our guide."
12843,I've always wanted to thank you. For saving our star.
12844,I'm certain she knows.
12845,"We might have expected this, in retrospect."
12846,Fandaniel's...soul?
12847,Loss and grief beyond measure...
12848,That mask... That of Allag's greatest mind.
12849,It will take more than a bit of theater to frighten me.
12850,Are those...denizens of this star?
12851,Is this truly what Meteion and her sisters saw?
12852,A most grievous malady hath stricken this star.
12853,"Ugh, that smell..."
12854,"Aye, a most horrid calamity hath made a corpse of the star."
12855,"Gods, this is awful..."
12856,Such devastation... It defies belief.
12857,"Were all the stars she visited like this, I wonder?"
12858,To be fueled by hatred is no way to live.
12859,"They turned on each other, just like that?"
12860,To live only meant spreading this plague to others.
12861,I'm not sure how much more I can stand to see.
12862,'Twould seem this beast drinketh deep of pestilence...
12863,It's as if the affliction warps their very bones.
12864,I pity them.
12865,Perhaps death would have been kinder...
12866,Would that this were not merely a memory.
12867,I think I've had my fill of this nightmare.
12868,That any star should suffer such a fate...
12869,Telling that Meteion recalls their suffering in such detail.
12870,A hollow victory.
12871,I know. We can but pray it found peace in the hereafter.
12872,Has she thrown us into the middle of a war!?
12873,"This star was sundered by war, then?"
12874,Yet they saw not what they had wrought ere it consumed them...
12875,Such wanton destruction...
12876,A fate I pray never comes to pass on Etheirys.
12877,Does she truly believe this is the fate of all peoples?
12878,"Surely, there were those who sought to end the bloodshed?"
12879,Not everyone would have abandoned hope. I know it...
12880,"Whatever freedom they found, I'm sure it was short-lived."
12881,Or mayhap it was not freedom at all.
12882,That's a big one.
12883,We've come too far to back down now.
12884,Was <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103> meant to bring an end to the war?
12885,They could have accomplished so much good with their knowledge...
12886,Hmph. I've seen bigger.
12887,I can see why you chose to lock the Crystal Tower.
12888,That brings back memories I'd much rather forget.
12889,"Come on, we have to keep going!"
12890,"Peace through exterminating its creators... “Peacekeeper,” indeed."
12891,This is not at all what technology was meant for!
12892,"This could have been us, had we been unable to stop the war..."
12893,"“Freedom through technology.” If not for that, we wouldn't be here."
12894,This place is...beautiful.
12895,"Their end came not for want, but for the lack of it..."
12896,How could anyone despair in a world such as this?
12897,This place feels strangely devoid of life...
12898,...
12899,Looks can deceive. This place is beautiful...but cold.
12900,They should be here somewhere... 
12901,O-Oh my! They appear to be coming this way!
12902,Run for the hills!
12903,<rustle> <rustle> <rustle>
12904,<rustle> <rustle> <rustle>
12905,You shall not take the wind from our wings!
12906,This poison...is too strong...
12907,Ah! My aether wanes...!
12908,The summoning must needs be completed!
12909,We...have failed...
12910,"The parts I seek... So near, yet so far!"
12911,I'll have to search elsewhere.
12912,We hunted high and low for these provisions.
12913,Jotnar! They're closing in!
12914,What a terrible waste...
12915,"Get back! Back, I say!"
12916,The provisions are safe! Thank you!
12917,Bwaaaaaagh!
12918,Graaah!
12919,Significant damage to imperial capital detected. Initiating automated combat protocol.
12920,Unidentified combatant detected. Commencing attack.
12921,Glory...be...
12922,For the Empire...
12923,Is nowhere safe!?
12924,...How!? How did it come to this!?
12925,HeLp... PlEaSe...
12926,Is my time not yet come?
12927,"Please, Ra-la, come back! I long for release!"
12928,Has my time come at last?
12929,"Please, I beg of you─end my suffering."
12930,G-Guh-Garlemaaald...
12931,F-F-For the...Empire...
12932,"Mwahaha... Oh, how I long for that sticky sensation!"
12933,"Oh, I must needs get more of that marvelous goo..."
12934,Relinquish your aether!
12935,Behold the genius of my design!
12936,Slough off your accursed flesh!
12937,My aether consume you!
12938,There will be no quarter!
12939,Blind them with your brilliance!
12940,You will play your part...
12941,Flee in terror!
12942,Submit!
12943,Begone!
12944,Your end is nigh...
12945,A keyward is to be obeyed!
12946,I have been granted power untold!
12947,"Oh, thank you..."
12948,Free at last!
12949,Can I finally go home?
12950,Ah...!
12951,They must be around here some─<hex:02100103>There!
12952,"Oh my, there are quite a lot of them..."
12953,"...Er, a little help?<hex:02100103>These seedlings must be exterminated!"
12954,That takes care of that particular mess!
12955,I don't suppose you're free to clean up another...?
12956,Bother.<hex:02100103>I was hoping we could contain the situation...
12957,Argh!
12958,<cough> ...Ugh... <wheeze>
12959,This is unacceptable...
12960,We'll never get her back to the cave without incident.
12961,I'm afraid this specimen requires termination. If you please...?
12962,Professor!<hex:02100103>Professor Gilly!
12963,We've had reports of a situation evolving in the Central Circuit!
12964,Your presence is required immediately!
12965,The specimen is no longer a threat. Excellent work!
12966,What? What now!? I thought we had things under control!
12967,"Come along, then, Sathzant!"
12968,This is not going to look good on my review...
12969,"The reactor remains intact, thank the Scholar."
12970,They seem drawn by the aetheric energy...
12971,This experiment is over!<hex:02100103>Shatter those crystal beasts!
12972,That should do it.
12973,But I should like to check on the other reactors.
12974,"Anyone willing to assist, come with me!"
12975,What a disaster...<hex:02100103>I'll have to file a report.
12976,I will not yield!
12977,We will weather any storm!
12978,The winds favor us!
12979,You're in my sights!
12980,Like an arrow from Llymlaen!
12981,Pshhh! Brayflox feels ouchy...
12982,You have my eternal gratitude!
12983,My friends will be thrilled and relieved in equal measure!
12984,I'll accept anything you can find!
12985,"Hooray! Now, to return home and bathe in gooey bliss!"
12986,Mwahaha! That sticky slime must be mine!
12987,"Come one, come all! Step right up and punch me in the face!"
12988,Perpetrate violence to win fabulous prizes!
12989,My suffering for your satisfaction!
12990,Do not be shy! You cannot kill that which has no life!
12991,No...? How disappointing.
12992,Challengers? How wonderful!
12993,"Yes, yes! More blood and oil!"
12994,"Harder! <hex:021A020203>Harder<hex:021A020103>! You want your prize, don't you?"
12995,"Winner, winner, carrot dinner!"
12996,Better luck next time!
12997,Test your strength for a chance at wondrous prizes!
12998,Sate your thirst for blood and reap rich rewards!
12999,"I will hold nothing back, so give it your all!"
13000,You must ask yourself: are you feeling lucky?
13001,No challengers... Perhaps another time.
13002,"Show me your rage, your rancor!"
13003,You'll win no prizes at this rate!
13004,Folly or fortune? Which will it be?
13005,So you have chosen...fortune?
13006,"Come to play, have you? Then let's begin!"
13007,Round and round we go!
13008,Oh dear... I'm feeling dizzy.
13009,By my words find riches or ruin.<hex:02100103>The choice is yours.
13010,What stumbles and flails?<hex:02100103>The burned man.
13011,What waits unmoving?<hex:02100103>Brittle bones.
13012,What comes unto me?<hex:02100103>The trapped.
13013,What flees my reach?<hex:02100103>The doomed man.
13014,What stands alone?<hex:02100103>The dead oak.
13015,What stand together?<hex:02100103>Walls turned to ash.
13016,Yes... This is what I longed to feel once more...
13017,"Long ago, I fought for honor...for glory..."
13018,Tiny warrior... I sense in thee a kindred spirit.
13019,Thou hath reawoken me to the thrill of battle!
13020,Tigers...?<hex:02100103>How is this possible?
13021,The aetheric ice! It's powered some kind of...evolution.
13022,We have to break them.<hex:02100103>Break them now!
13023,"Yes, the creatures appear thoroughly pulverized."
13024,And the reactor seems none the worse for wear. Thank you!
13025,Everything in order here?
13026,Professor Gilly!<hex:02100103>It was a near thing...
13027,We shall have to rethink our experiment protocol from the ground up.
13028,Understood! I'll start drafting improvements at once!
13029,They've grown too powerful. We withdraw for now...
13030,"Nay, 'tis not enough..."
13031,Naught remaineth for me but to sink into oblivion...
13032,"Many thanks, friend. If I'd gone myself, I'd have ended up as some gaja's supper."
13033,"If I'm going to risk my life for this job, I want double the coin. Back to town it is, then!"
13034,THERE IS NO CREATION...WITHOUT DESTRUCTION!
13035,BEHIND EVERY SMILE...IS DEATH AND ANNIHILATION!
13036,A glorious battle indeed...
13037,"So glorious as to inspire a new song, methinks."
13038,"I thank thee for thine aid, little one."
13039,"Farewell to thee, friend."
13040,"Victorious, as ever..."
13041,Yet to triumph with ease bringeth no glory.
13042,"Farewell to thee, little one."
13043,How now? Wilt thou rise to my challenge?
13044,I'vE no nEed fOr an iMperFect ForM...
13045,CurSe tHis wReTchEd boDy...
13046,HrRrgrRr...
13047,<growl>
13048,<rumble>
13049,<screech>
13050,<hiss>
13051,<roar>
13052,"Oh, what a lovely scent! Thank you ever so much!"
13053,What a wondrous perfume I will be able to fashion now!
13054,"'Tis a shame, but I'll simply have to acquire my blossoms through other means."
13055,Bah! Winged monstrosities! Begone from this place!
13056,"Oh, no! I've gone and dropped all my blossoms!"
13057,"Oh dear, oh dear! Whatever shall I do!?"
13058,It seems they've been drawn here by the flowers' most alluring aroma.
13059,"Oh, thank you! Now, to pick up all these blossoms..."
13060,Phew! This flower appears undamaged...
13061,"And...yes, this flower is safe as well!"
13062,I have them all! Now to return and whip up the realm's most lovely perfume!
13063,"Oh, woe is me! Must I truly start all over again...?"
13064,All shall end...
13065,The end cometh...
13066,Someone help!
13067,That hurteth...
13068,Stay back!
13069,W-We are saved!
13070,Many thanks!
13071,Nay... Please...
13072,How shall I ever face Overseer Sokles again?
13073,I've only t-to fall to my knees. Beg for forgiveness!
13074,"Oh, thank you─I am saved, truly! I shall bring these to Overseer Sokles at once."
13075,"Should you happen upon any of those documents, do bring them to me."
13076,"Please, oh please, let this way lead out!"
13077,I just want to go home!
13078,"This hallway again!? Ugh, I need to get out of here!"
13079,There's nothing <hex:021A020203>happy<hex:021A020103> about this place!
13080,Does an exit even exist here?
13081,Concentrate!
13082,It is nothing.
13083,'Tis but a scratch!
13084,"Confound it, where did everyone go...?"
13085,"Uwaaah, lizards! Help! Someone, help!"
13086,Please don't eat me! I'm all skin and bones!
13087,"O merciful Mrga, deliver us from evil!"
13088,"Oh, praise be to the Mrga for sending you to me!"
13089,I'm on a pilgrimage to seek salvation from the gods.
13090,But I became separated from my companions.
13091,I will try and catch up to them now.
13092,"Thank you, and may the Mrga bless and keep you!"
13093,So much for the pilgrimage... Best flee while I can!
13094,Uwaaah! Did you see the way that gaja looked at me!? It wants me for supper!
13095,The beaches are overrun with those damn valras of late...
13096,How am I supposed to go fishing with these blasted creatures about!? Am I doomed to starve to death?
13097,"Oh, thank you for dispatching those monsters! Finally I can fish again!"
13098,I suppose I'll put away my fishing pole and hope for better luck tomorrow...
13099,Empty-handed again... The buyers at the market will be oh so disappointed in me...
13100,We did it! They were no match for us!
13101,"Oh, but what about you?"
13102,I hope you weren't injured...
13103,Eheheh... This data is precisely what I needed!
13104,Come─quickly! There's much work to be done!
13105,W-Wait! Where are you going!?
13106,Pl-Please! Somebody help!
13107,We have to get everyone to safety!
13108,
13109,"Oh, you there! Familiar! Yes, <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103>. Come here and give me a hand with something, won't you?"
13110,I'm looking for one who might do a bit of sparring against some creations to help spark my creativity. Are there truly none available for such a task?
13111,"I just need someone─anyone, really─to engage my aigokeros in combat. I must see how it performs when faced with an attacker."
13112,"Very well done, familiar, and thank you. I can sense great thoughts about to form... Any moment now... "
13113,"Well, this isn't helping my creativity at all. Time to try a new tack."
13114,It's as if I lack imagination enough to create anything at all.
13115,"Hmmm, this gives me much to consider."
13116,Fascinating... Truly fascinating... 
13117,<whinny>
13118,No... I cannot move...
13119,Ugh... My lance grows heavy...
13120,No! I shall not fall before this beast!
13121,There you all are! ...Hm? What's the matter?
13122,"The sacred site is just yonder, but there are too many fiends..."
13123,"O benevolent Mrga, open the way for us!"
13124,"This must be a trial... Yes, our faith is being tested."
13125,We will persevere. We must!
13126,Saved yet again! You have our gratitude!
13127,"Come, let us pray. O mighty Mrga...!"
13128,"There... This leaves just the sea shrine, I believe."
13129,"Indeed. The end is in sight, my friends."
13130,Let us stay focused to the last.
13131,No... We've come too far to fall short like this...
13132,"Eheheh! Well done, adventurer!"
13133,This data will help me truly complete my masterpiece.
13134,
13135,"Oh, dear... What are you scheming now!?"
13136,Don't hold back now: give these robots your all! Eheheh...
13137,"If you'll excuse me, it's time to retreat...eheheh!"
13138,Go on─send these rowdy robots to the scrap heap!
13139,"Nothing ignites the imagination quite like a row. To that end, I shall pit you against an altogether different creature this time."
13140,"In fact, this is a variety I've only just recently registered with the bureau. Now then, show me what you can do!"
13141,"Oh, I am flooded with inspiration. Visions of extraordinary concepts come upon me, the likes of which you would not believe!"
13142,"Thank you, familiar. Your assistance proved most invaluable. How I look forward to the day I can share my new works with you!"
13143,I must put this to paper before I forget all that I have conjured.
13144,Is this truly the limits of my imagination? Is there no method for me to improve upon my methods?
13145,"Alack, I am in desperate need of some inspiration."
13146,"Ah, yes. Why of course... "
13147,"Well, a thing like that... "
13148,Graaaaaah!
13149,Graaaghhh!
13150,M-Mother... I...
13151,Hells take you...Guildivain...
13152,"Eheheh... Arise, my creation!"
13153,SUPERCARROT ACTIVATED. OUTPUT EXCEEDING 260%...
13154,INITIATING EXTERMINATION MODE. WEAKLINGS MUST PERISH!
13155,Eheheh... Such incredible power!
13156,"And, er, if anyone can help me shut it down, that'd be swell!"
13157,Eheheh! Could someone lend me a hand?
13158,Whew! That was far too close...
13159,Eheheh! This has provided me with invaluable data. 
13160,My next order of business is cranking the output up to 300%!
13161,Wh-What? That robot nearly killed you and <hex:021A020203>that's<hex:021A020103> your takeaway!?
13162,"If you'll excuse me, it's time to retreat...eheheh!"
13163,Don't be shy─turn my masterpiece into scrap metal!
13164,EXTERMINATION MODE ACTIVATED. WEAKLINGS MUST PERISH!
13165,SUPERCARROT OUTPUT EXCEEDING LIMITS... WARNING!
13166,Looks like we're safe for the time being.
13167,Phew... Too close for comfort...
13168,Many thanks for your timely assistance!
13169,Did you find anything?
13170,Aye. The methods I'd researched prior to my defection...
13171,...were used in this magitek.
13172,"Then it's true... So, where to next?"
13173,Let's search the facility at which I was stationed.
13174,We may be able to glean vital information there.
13175,Very well. I'll follow your lead.
13176,Beautiful creatures...the time has come.
13177,Death's sweet release.
13178,Death delivered on golden wings...
13179,"Ah, finally we are free."
13180,How did they get here!?
13181,Remember your orders! No survivors!
13182,Global Community scum!
13183,Fire! Fire!
13184,We have them now!
13185,For freedom!
13186,Keep it up!
13187,No... Not yet...
13188,"Oh, d-d-dear..."
13189,We can't lose...
13190,Understood! Stand back!
13191,No fiends here...<hex:02100103>But what might this be?
13192,"Oh, familiar! Over here!"
13193,"Prepare to be awed by my masterpiece! But not too awed, mind you. You'll need your wits about you for this fight, I should think."
13194,"Long have I observed the creatures of this world, how they kill and maim, and at last, my studies bear fruit. Behold the product of my research!"
13195,O-Oh... This is not <hex:021A020203>quite<hex:021A020103> how I envisioned my concept. It was a great deal different on paper... At any rate─ Attack!
13196,"In my profession, that is what we call an abject failure. Perhaps I let my fancy carry me too far in the design phase... I will have to try, try again!"
13197,"Well, this is all wrong. All wrong, indeed! How in goodness gracious did I come up with...<hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>?"
13198,"No, no, no. This is bad, so very bad... "
13199,Wh-What is it? H-How did it end up like that?
13200,Where could I have gone so horribly wrong?
13201,We won't let you get away this time!
13202,Damn you!
13203,"This is it─the last stop on our pilgrimage. Come, let us pray!"
13204,"Whew... As much devotion as we've shown, the Mrga have surely heard us."
13205,Look! Something's coming from Narunnair!
13206,Uwaaah! It's a monster!
13207,Th-This isn't our god!
13208,Run for your lives!
13209,Th-They vanquished that monster?
13210,To think that mortals could be so strong...
13211,Could this be what the scriptures mean about being one's own light?
13212,"Relying not upon gods, but yourself to guide you..."
13213,"Yes... Yes, that's it. What's important is our own will and determination."
13214,"So in the face of hardship, we should look not to the divine, but the strength within..."
13215,"Precisely. If we are agreed, then let us walk this path together!"
13216,"Hear, hear!"
13217,"It's been a pleasure, my friends. Till next time, may all continue to strive for enlightenment!  "
13218,"My wee little nanka has returned to the sea! Oh, it brings a tear to the eye! Thank you, my friends!"
13219,"Oh, dear...this isn't good. Come, my little one─we'd best head home."
13220,"Don't worry, we'll get out of this."
13221,"B-Brother, I'm scared!"
13222,Bhujamga... Why did it have to be bhujamga?
13223,Thanks for saving us!
13224,Now we can go home!
13225,Q-Quietly now...
13226,N-Now's our chance! This way!
13227,"Manusya have mercy, it's the man-eaters!"
13228,They could attack at any moment... What are we going to do!?
13229,They've turned tail! Huzzah!
13230,Now we can rest easy! Thank you!
13231,Uwaaah! They're coming!
13232,We must warn everyone!
13233,Thank you for ridding me of those langurs! Now I can gather the herbs without fear.
13234,Oh dear... Perhaps I should look for the herbs elsewhere...
13235,Steel yourself!
13236,
13237,Now we press the attack!
13238,"Calm yourself. Focus, and picture it clearly in your mind's eye... Hellacious horns, rippling thew, a fearsome eye!"
13239,"Behold, my greatest concept yet: the kyklops! Now, draw your weapon and succumb to a strength beyond measure!"
13240,"Why...you defeated it! Goodness me, what an incredible familiar you are."
13241,"But rest assured, I have witnessed all most carefully, and see clearly what must be done to fix my creation. I shall return to Anamnesis Anyder and perform the final touches."
13242,"A very enlightening show that was, I must say."
13243,I cannot rightly believe it. My creation─ It's won! Then perhaps this truly is the latest <hex:021A020203>and<hex:021A020103> greatest creature.
13244,Though there is still much yet to be fine-tuned.
13245,That's the spirit!
13246,"I believe in you, kyklops! You can do this."
13247,"Oh no, the crates...<hex:02100103>OH NO, THE SPIDERS!"
13248,"Do I have one in my hair!?<hex:02100103>Please, someone help!"
13249,The nightmare is over...<hex:02100103>Thank you!
13250,M-Maybe we can round them up with lizards...or scorpions!
13251,"My, how adorable!"
13252,I thought those plants looked unfamiliar...
13253,And they looked so cuddly...
13254,Hm. No more botanical studies today.
13255,I've never seen anything like this!
13256,"And I'd rather my superiors not see it at all, if you catch my drift..."
13257,Thank you! I'll just...sweep these chunks away.
13258,<sigh> I'd better start writing the incident report...
13259,The laboratory calls! I shall be sure to make mention of you in my paper's footnotes!
13260,"So much time for such a paltry number of samples... No, I must return to my desk and rethink this entire research proposal!"
13261,"Thanks to you, the truth is no longer out there! The bulk of it is back in my hands, and that's where I intend to keep it!"
13262,"This is it. This is the end. Once word gets out that I lost these documents, the contract violation fines alone will be the death of me..."
13263,Let's make sure the next specimen is <hex:021A020203>flora<hex:021A020103>...
13264,It ends here!
13265,Do not underestimate me!

13308,We must gather the necessary components as swiftly as possible.
13309,Lead the way!
13310,"Oh gods, there's no stopping it now... Ebrelnaux!"
13311,Preening fool! Stay alert!
13312,The Sun does not heed the barking of feral dogs!
13313,"The farther we go, the worse this place gets..."
13314,Indeed. We'd best be prepared for any eventuality.
13315,"Were you able to find anything of note, Keltlona?"
13316,No such luck. It all looks like junk to me.
13317,"Alas, my search proved equally unproductive."
13318,"However, there's another location that is worth a try."
13319,We are now close to the munitions factory.
13320,That is where the automation process must've been carried out on older units.
13321,"And there is our welcoming party, right on cue."
13322,It appears that was the last of the smaller units.
13323,"But they were no more than sub-units, or underlings, one might say."
13324,The commanding unit should be nearby!
13325,"That's our true target, yes?"
13326,Correct. I believe it contains the components I require.
13327,Excellent! You've succeeded in deactivating it!
13328,Words cannot express my gratitude.
13329,"Once I've retrieved the necessary parts, I'll make my way back to camp."
13330,"Soon, Garlemald will be free of automated magitek, and the people may reclaim their city."
13331,A far more stubborn foe than anticipated. Let us retreat for the time being.
13332,Understood.
13333,"As this unit's directive has been fulfilled, this mission is complete."
13334,Retrieved memory data will be analyzed for the further optimization of our protocols.
13335,Sentimentality levels increasing... This unit bids farewell to you and its fallen comrade.
13336,Apathy is no excuse to give up on living.
13337,They lost their passion for <hex:021A020203>everything<hex:021A020103>? Even life itself?
13338,That apathy could usurp their will to live is horrifying to say the least.
13339,I pray such a future never comes to pass on Etheirys.
13340,And so the world died without so much as a whimper.
13341,Was this what brought about their end?
13342,No... How could they?
13343,Our world will never succumb to such a fate.
13344,Let us show Meteion what it means to have hope.
13345,Was this meant to discourage us? Hmph.
13346,"They may have given up, but it's no reason for us to lose hope."
13347,As one!
13348,Show them what we're made of!
13349,I owe you for that!
13350,Try this!
13351,
13352,Another experiment gone wrong... How am I not surprised!?
13353,
13354,"Please, keep my merinos safe!"
13355,"Now then, the herbs should grow here..."
13356,Don't let them spit on the sheep!
13357,This is like finding a needle in a haystack...
13358,I don't see anything even close to what Ebrelnaux described.
13359,There must be some hint as to the inner working of these automated weapons...
13360,Please... Let there be <hex:021A020203>something<hex:021A020103> left!
13361,Nothing. That can only mean...
13362,Argh! Someone help!
13363,"Hold on, I'll request support!"
13364,It's no good. We'll have to abandon the search!
13365,You're right. Let's fall back!
13366,We'll never get past them at this rate.
13367,Agreed. Let's regroup and think of another approach.
13368,But whatever will I do about those langurs...?
13369,Go─fly!
13370,L-Look out!
13371,Ugh...
13372,Gwah!
13373,Marvelously done! Thank you.
13374,"Oh, those poor monocerotes."
13375,"Have courage, monocerotes!"
13376,Do not give in!
13377,Get behind me!
13378,"It's up to you, Fordola!"
13379,Gah... My limbs refuse to move!
13380,
13381,0
13382,My prayers have been heard!
13383,May your embrace shield us...
13384,...And cleanse the corruption from our home!
13385,By the grace of the elementals!
13386,Ugh...
13387,It's no good!
13388,We've got to weather the storm!
13389,We'll not fall so easily!
13390,Watch yourselves!
13391,Much obliged! Now let's give those pesky blighters what for!
13392,Hop to it now!
13393,Hrrrgrah!
13394,Ehehe... Splendid!
13395,How many malfunctions will it take for you to learn your lesson!?
13396,We must stand our ground!
13397,There!
13398,This knight does not yield!
13399,I've never seen anything like this!
13400,"And I'd rather my superiors not see it at all, if you catch my drift..."
13401,Uwaaah! Did you see the way that gaja looked at me!? It wants me for supper!
13402,The beaches are overrun with those damn valras of late...
13403,How am I supposed to go fishing with these blasted creatures about!? Am I doomed to starve to death?
13404,"Don't worry, we'll get out of this."
13405,"B-Brother, I'm scared!"
13406,Bhujamga... Why did it have to be bhujamga?
13407,"Manusya have mercy, it's the man-eaters!"
13408,They could attack at any moment... What are we going to do!?
13409,"My, how adorable!"
13410,I thought those plants looked unfamiliar...
13411,"Do I have one in my hair!?<hex:02100103>Please, someone help!"
13412,I will not falter!
13413,For the honor of House Fortemps!
13414,Now!
13415,
13416,Ugh!
13417,Such power...
13418,Leave this to me!
13419,We cannot fail!
13420,He's quicker than he looks!
13421,What strength...
13422,"That's it, Fordola!"
13423,"They'll win, I know they will!"
13424,You've got to hold on!
13425,"Thank you, Elder Seedseer!"
13426,By the light of the Crystal!
13427,Begone with you!
13428,Wood's will be done!
13429,Ungh... I shall endure!
13430,I shall not kneel before your fury!
13431,I have suffered much worse!
13432,No... This cannot be...
13433,Ugh... I cannot fight much longer...
13434,We have to get away from here!
13435,What's wrong?
13436,Mother?
13437,It's hopeless! Hopeless!
13438,No! No! Noooooo!
13439,Make it stop! Make it stop!
13440,Mother! I...I... Gaaahhhrrrgh! 
13441,I'm just getting started!
13442,Grant me Kardion!
13443,Gah...! This bloody poison...!
13444,Uhhh...
13445,Unnngh...
13446,Aaargh...
13447,Ahhh!
13448,<gasp>
13449,<pant> <pant>
13450,I owe you!
13451,My thanks!
13452,Your compliance is not a factor.
13453,Executing peace protocol. Commencing extermination.
13454,There!
13455,You cannot stop us!
13456,An opening!
13457,We mustn't hold back!
13458,You'll not escape this!
13459,Now!
13460,Are you all right?
13461,I have you!
13462,We must stay strong!
13463,Keep it up!
13464,We can do this!
13465,Just a little more!
13466,We've come too far to fall short here!
13467,Go forth!
13468,Begone!
13469,Enough!
13470,"Behold, amber brilliance!"
13471,My magicks are without peer!
13472,'Tis a most fearsome familiar.
13473,Art thou hurt?
13474,Hold steady.
13475,"Be at ease, my friend."
13476,I shall assist thee.
13477,Let us not falter.
13478,"Have care, my friend."
13479,A shower of amber to lay low my foes!
13480,This can't end here...
13481,Is that all you've got.
13482,You've not won yet!
13483,My thanks...
13484,They'll pay for that.
13485,Back to the fray!
13486,Fall!
13487,This will hurt!
13488,You underestimate me!
13489,You're mine!
13490,Time to end this!
13491,All or nothing!
13492,"Up, up!"
13493,Are you all right?
13494,We're not done here.
13495,Hang in there!
13496,Courage!
13497,Stay strong!
13498,"Roar, Nidhogg! Roar!"
13499,Quite...
13500,This is nothing.
13501,A poor showing...
13502,I will do better.
13503,It isn't over yet.
13504,I'm in your debt.
13505,Have at you!
13506,Have a taste!
13507,Prepare yourself!
13508,My blade sings!
13509,No quarter!
13510,Can you withstand this?
13511,"Open your eyes, now."
13512,I will tend your wounds.
13513,Your journey isn't over yet.
13514,Stand firm.
13515,Stay the course.
13516,Mayhap this will help.
13517,Let Death's judgment be stayed!
13518,"Rend? Nay, this shall more than suffice."
13519,Let Life flow ever abundant!
13520,Another fine mess...
13521,This is going swimmingly...
13522,Would someone hurry up and heal me!?
13523,I do have an image to uphold.
13524,Time to repay the debt.
13525,"Slow. A sound choice, but slow."
13526,Begone!
13527,Mine is the aether!
13528,Fall!
13529,Down with you!
13530,Out of my way!
13531,Do not underestimate me.
13532,"Steady, now."
13533,What a bother...
13534,Look alive.
13535,"Oh, very well..."
13536,"Pay attention, now."
13537,Don't waste this.
13538,"By my true name, I shall consign all."
13539,"On my seat's honor, I shall protect all."
13540,Not quite as planned...
13541,I've had better days...
13542,"Some healing, if you would?"
13543,"You shouldn't have─no, really."
13544,What? Already?
13545,"Well, back to it, I suppose."
13546,What do you think of this?
13547,"I see you, opening!"
13548,Hope this works!
13549,From concept to creation!
13550,"Now, now, it's rude to interrupt."
13551,I'm not entirely useless.
13552,As you were.
13553,Are you all right?
13554,"Pain, pain, go away."
13555,"Ooh, interesting!"
13556,I have a proposal.
13557,Let's make a little something.
13558,Who? Me!? You can't be serious...
13559,Survivors?
13560,"No, wait. Something's amiss."
13561,Good gods...
13562,Get them to safety!
13563,You must remain calm!
13564,No...
13565,"Look, over there!"
13566,"Please, hold on!"
13567,Is there nothing we can do!?
13568,The aether is dissipating!
13569,The change is spreading!
13570,All is in disarray...
13571,We've got to protect them!
13572,We're here to help!
13573,I can't believe what I'm seeing...
13574,Look out!
13575,Be on your guard.
13576,...
13577,If this is what we must do...
13578,Look out!
13579,Fall!
13580,You...you are unharmed? Thank goodness...
13581,"To me, my loyal servants!"
13582,The power is mine!
13583,The glory is mine!
13584,The power is mine!
13585,The glory is mine!
13586,"I yield... Have mercy, I beg you..."
13587,"Thordan!? Seven hells, he cannot mean to─!"
13588,"Hmph, your compassion will be the end of you..."
13589,All will perish!
13590,Estinien!
13591,Will there never be peace between man and dragon...?
13592,Graaaaaarrrghhh!
13593,"I would ask one last favor of you, Warrior of Light..."
13594,Finish me...
13595,"Now, while I have the beast subdued!"
13596,
13597,We must see Estinien to safety!
13598,
13599,Vile dragons! My reign begins with your end!
13600,What is thy bidding?
13601,In the name of King Thordan...
13602,Glory be to the Fury...
13603,Out of our way!
13604,Forward!
13605,Reinforcements!?
13606,Take cover!
13607,Prepare yourselves!
13608,0
13609,"Roar, Tizona!"
13610,Enough!
13611,There!
13612,Hyah!
13613,I think not!
13614,Have you now!
13615,Have at you!
13616,Hmph!
13617,Hah!
13618,"Press onward, my friends!"
13619,Go now! Before it's too late!
13620,You must hurry!
13621,
13622,
13623,
13624,
13625,
13626,
13627,This will sting.
13628,Rise! My legion!
13629,Rise! My faithful!
13630,No escape!
13631,Begone!
13632,Savages!
13633,For glory!
13634,For Garlemald!
13635,Death take you!
13636,Stay strong!
13637,Take heart!
13638,Leave this to us!
13639,This will sting.
13640,Out of my way!
13641,Unexpected... Most unexpected...
13642,Yaaaaaargh!
13643,Taste my blade!
13644,"They may be shades,<hex:02100103>but their blades are<hex:02100103>just as deadly!"
13645,On your guard!
13646,Ugh...
13647,Ungh... Damn it...
13648,Forgive me...my lord...
13649,Hmph!
13650,You cannot run!
13651,Don't be fools! Get away from here!
13652,
13653,So this is the power of the Builder...
13654,I'm sorry I cannot aid you in battle.
13655,Hm? Up ahead...
13656,It seems Rhalgr awaits us above.
13657,"Come, let us keep moving."
13658,Yet more servants of the gods!?
13659,"Azeyma, goddess of the sun..."
13660,
13661,
13662,No way but forward.
13663,
13664,This voice...
13665,
13666,Is it me or has Meteion grown a shade darker?
13667,How many worlds have stained her soul with despair?
13668,"Meteion hath taken a blackened hue. To reflect her heart, mayhap?"
13669,"Apathy...? Hmph, madness is what it was."
13670,You'll not dissuade us with these bleak visions of the past.
13671,Let us give the lie to her promise of ruin.
13672,We will grant you peace.
13673,We can't afford to slow down!
13674,On to the next one!
13675,"Civilians, up ahead!"
13676,I'll take care of this!
13677,The only way is forward!
13678,It's up to us now!
13679,Get behind me!
13680,Could that be...a Flood of Light!?
13681,Not good!
13682,Just a little more!
13683,We will...stand our ground!
13684,The world's fate doth rest on our shoulders...
13685,We cannot fail here!
13686,"Roar, Nidhogg!"
13687,We <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> succeed!
13688,"Now's our chance, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
13689,What frightful presence doth assault my senses?
13690,By the Twelve...
13691,May thine end be without pain...
13692,You have wallowed long enough!
13693,"That nail could be trouble. Come, help me destroy it!"
13694,
13695,
13696,
13697,
13698,
13699,
13700,
13701,Something doesn't want us here...
13702,Doesn't it feel like we're being watched?
13703,W-Wait! Not so fast!
13704,Uwaaah!
13705,Gwaaah!
13706,I don't... I don't want to die...
13707,"Ah, the anticipation!"
13708,On we go!
13709,Oh? Oh dear.
13710,"Guard my person, if you would!"
13711,"Not so hasty, if you please!"
13712,
13713,Our flames will consume you!
13714,Bow down before us!
13715,Follow my lead!
13716,"Grrr, I am more than enough for your ilk!"
13717,With me!
13718,"Grrr, it isn't over yet!"
13719,We breathe as one!
13720,Hish hish hish!
13721,Mmm...
13722,Grrrgh!
13723,Shah shah!
13724,Hngh!?
13725,Argh!
13726,Uh!?
13727,Gah!
13728,Locating denizens.<hex:02100103>Opening portal...
13729,You're mine!
13730,You've nowhere to hide!
13731,I'll bludgeon you to death!
13732,Try this!
13733,It's over!
13734,To dust with you!
13735,Begone!
13736,Vermin!
13737,<squeak>!
13738,<squeak> <squeak>
13739,"Die, damn you!"
13740,"Die, die, DIE!"
13741,<squeak>! <squeak>!
13742,<squeak>♪ 
13743,<sniff> <squeak>
13744,Cluck cluck!
13745,Cluck... Cluck! Cluck!
13746,S-Stay back!
13747,Away with you!
13748,Savages!
13749,For Lord Gaius!
13750,For the Empire!
13751,That's as far as you go!
13752,Oh no you don't!
13753,Try this!
13754,There!
13755,Have at you!
13756,"Lightning, shriek!"
13757,"Lightning, burst!"
13758,Down with you!
13759,Prepare yourselves!
13760,I will not fall to mortals!
13761,Secure the treasure.
13762,Repel the intruders.
13763,Slay the looters.
13764,"Flee, or be feed for the fish."
13765,Damn it! How do those little legs carry them so fast!?
13766,"If we don't do something, they're all going to get away!"
13767,"Catch the rabbits, and the chickens will calm down for sure!"
13768,The chickens hold the bunnies at bay! Now's our chance!
13769,Happiness is ever so fleeting...
13770,Good gods! Never underestimate an angry chicken!
13771,Look how calm the chickens are! They must be exhausted after all that.
13772,There are still some stragglers. Let not a single bunny escape!
13773,"All right, my pretties. Back to the coop we go."
13774,W-Wait! Come back here!
13775,How are we supposed to catch these things?
13776,Just try to stay with them as best you can!
13777,You can thank me later.
13778,Onward!
13779,"Hurry, Leveilleur!"
13780,Well played.
13781,Know your place!
13782,"Have at thee, kupo!"
13783,"We'll tear you to pieces, kupo!"
13784,All will tremble before my might!
13785,Take this!
13786,"Help is on the way, kupo!"
13787,Hearken to the song of my people!
13788,"Y-You're in for it now, kupo!"
13789,Bear witness to the power of kupo!
13790,Hahaha! I've quite warmed to you!
13791,Let the fires rage!
13792,Brace yourselves!
13793,To arms!
13794,Attack!
13795,Corner them!
13796,Take them out!
13797,Hold nothing back!
13798,Down with you!
13799,Using Fortis!
13800,Dammit!
13801,"Damn it, looks like the core is gone..."
13802,This armor won't be taking another step.
13803,"The rest is up to you, my friend. Take care!"
13804,"Flee, damn you! Don't throw your lives away!"
13805,"Be careful, now!"
13806,Begone!
13807,Hahahaha!
13808,You withstood the Darkness!? Impossible!
13809,Nooo! You...you <hex:021A020203>bastard<hex:021A020103>!
13810,Yaaaaaargggh!
13811,Aaarrrgh!
13812,●焔扇よ…舞え…！
13813,Hmph. Yours was always a vain struggle.
13814,My thanks.
13815,They've not won yet...
13816,The path has been revealed!
13817,The winds favor us!
13818,Down with you!
13819,I have you!
13820,We mustn't yield. Not now!
13821,Is it...over?
13822,No...
13823,FiRe ThE cAnNoNs!
13824,"Thal, they are yours!"
13825,You will feel Thal's power!
13826,"Thal, let us change!"
13827,"Nald, it is your turn."
13828,Bask in Nald's divinity.
13829,"Nald, I leave them to you."
13830,Is this the limit of mankind?
13831,Prepare yourselves.
13832,I will show you to the Underworld.
13833,We have hostiles! To arms!
13834,Sound the alarm!
13835,Hold it right there!
13836,Intruders!
13837,How did they get here!?
13838,Behold. The lanterns ignite in the glyph's presence.
13839,And thus we take our first step into the unknown.
13840,This isle is where we find the vault's entrance?
13841,Time to learn just how authentic our map truly is...
13842,Our adventure begins!
13843,What a peculiar enchantment...
13844,The glyph works its magic once more...
13845,A bridge out of thin air...or cleverly hidden!
13846,"An invisibility spell removed, mayhap?"
13847,"'Tis a rare breed of jellyfish─one with a sting, I imagine."
13848,"My, what dense aether this creature has."
13849,This gelatinous eyesore bars our path.
13850,"'Tis a rare breed of jellyfish─one with a sting, I imagine."
13851,Might that device be our sought-after “entrance”?
13852,Shall we move on?<hex:02100103>That looks to be a teleporter.
13853,If only it had been a squid.<hex:02100103>Imagine all the dried rations...
13854,"I'd rather not.<hex:02100103>Oh look, is that a teleporter?"
13855,This must be the satrap's vault.<hex:02100103>Such fascinating design...
13856,We've descended quite some distance...
13857,Look!<hex:02100103>We're deep under the Bounty!
13858,The ocean floor...<hex:02100103>The map was no fake after all.
13859,Then our map was no fake after all.
13860,I must needs memorize these defenses...
13861,"Judging by these defenses, we must be nearing the treasure!"
13862,We appear to have angered the vault guardians.
13863,You are really quite serious about this consulting role of yours.
13864,Hm. The key guardians appear mechanical in nature.
13865,It will take more than this to halt our expedition.
13866,A formidable-looking foe.<hex:02100103>Be on your guard!
13867,Please remember to heal whilst you take notes!
13868,"Attack routines, behavioral patterns...<hex:02100103>There is much to report."
13869,Shall we continue onwards?
13870,Another obstacle overcome! Now on to the next!
13871,I only hope the Loporrits do not “misinterpret” the data.
13872,Mountains of gold to dazzle the eye. Noted.
13873,"I assume we've reached the vault's inner chambers, then?"
13874,Aye...this should more than cover the price of the map.
13875,"How much <hex:021A020203>did<hex:021A020103> you pay for it, anyway?"
13876,"Secret doors, hidden paths.<hex:02100103>More elements to consider."
13877,There are yet more rooms beyond!?
13878,What other riches might this one vault hold?
13879,"Ere long, you shall be a veritable vault expert!"
13880,'Tis some manner of arcane automaton...
13881,'Tis wrapped in aether-imbued silks...
13882,What is this oversized mammet?
13883,"No mere adornments, then."
13884,My head...<hex:02100103>Is everyone all right?
13885,You'll...ulp...pay for that!
13886,Well...that was an experience.
13887,"Those silks...<hex:02100103>Fashioned by alchemy, I suspect."
13888,How undignified...
13889,We regroup...and counterattack!
13890,What foolishness is this...?
13891,"Keep your wits, and it's not so bad..."
13892,"Again!?<hex:02100103>Grrr, this is getting old!"
13893,Ulp... I think I might be sick...
13894,The enchanted fabric saps our very strength.
13895,"Oh, you burn now, weaver."
13896,Just let...me catch...my breath!
13897,Why can I not jump free?<hex:02100103>Too much rich food of late...
13898,He means to resurrect them again!
13899,Get clear!
13900,The least I expected from the one who defeated Zenos.
13901,This bodes ill...
13902,"Quickly, stand together!"
13903,She can turn voidsent into crystal...
13904,Reinforcements...
13905,I'll do this my way.
13906,"Hm, impressive."
13907,Ugh!
13908,Zero needs our help!
13909,Another debt to repay...
13910,"Everyone, to me!"
13911,Give it everything you've got!
13912,"Come, fill your lungs!"
13913,You must die!
13914,My blade thirstsss for blood!
13915,"Deal with them, my minions!"
13916,
13917,Unnngh... Hungry...
13918,Must feed...
13919,So hungry... Must feed—must feast!
13920,Grrruuugh... Graaahhh!
13921,Begone.
13922,That's far enough.
13923,Got you!
13924,This <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> hurt.
13925,Go forth and smite my foes!
13926,More... I need more servants...
13927,Prove your loyalty to me!
13928,Isn't there a soul worth a damn in this castle!?
13929,Over here!
13930,"Hmph, let them come."
13931,A troublesome foe...
13932,No... I cannot─will not─lose!
13933,Damn it...
13934,
13935,Darkness shall consume Light!
13936,
13937,Chaos shall reign forevermore!
13938,Know your place!
13939,
13940,
13941,Your Light shall burn no more!
13942,Nothing shall remain!
13943,Your Light shall burn no more!
13944,"Partake of my life, Lahabrea!"
13945,"Defeat is unacceptable, Igeyorhm!"
13946,
13947,
13948,
13949,
13950,
13951,Here I go!
13952,Taste my axe!
13953,Yaaaaaargh!
13954,I'm going in!
13955,I'll draw the enemy!
13956,Feel my fury!
13957,Chaaaaaarge!
13958,You won't touch my comrades!
13959,My adventurer's soul burns!
13960,Adventurers never give up!
13961,Back to it!
13962,"Right, just like in training..."
13963,0
13964,Time to put this technique to use!
13965,This ought to do the trick!
13966,Something new I learned!
13967,No holding back!
13968,I'll pierce the way!
13969,A technique I honed on my adventures!
13970,The mind is the only limit!
13971,I'll get up as often as it takes!
13972,"L-Lightning...er, strike!"
13973,"F-Fire...er, scorch!"
13974,"S-Stars above...er, descend!"
13975,Lightning scour you!
13976,Flames consume you!
13977,Stars rain death upon you!
13978,"Puissant lightning, unleash your power!"
13979,"Flames of judgment, blaze and burn!"
13980,Time to use my trump card!
13981,"Right, let's try this again!"
13982,"H-Hold on, I'll heal you!"
13983,"O-Oh no! Get up, please!"
13984,A-A chance to attack!
13985,Healing for all!
13986,On your feet!
13987,My chance to strike!
13988,I'll tend your hurts!
13989,You're not finished yet!
13990,I'm going on the attack!
13991,Forgive me...
13992,
13993,
13994,Graaagggh... 
13995,Arrrgggh...
13996,Hurrrghhh...
13997,Mortals! Delicious mortals!
13998,Give me your aether!
13999,Intruders!
14000,To arms! To arms!
14001,Let none escape!
14002,Strike them down!
14003,Make yourselves useful<hex:02100103>or you'll be food too!
14004,Such a sumptuous feast...<hex:02100103>Mistress will be pleased!
14005,Have at them!
14006,Their aether will make me strong!
14007,As you wish...
14008,Your will be done!
14009,
14010,We will serve you up!
14011,"Stay close to me, Snoegeim!"
14012,Be on your guard!
14013,Wh-What's happening!?
14014,What an amazing mechanism!
14015,A-merrily we shall go!
14016,"Come out, come out, my animal friends!"
14017,"Oh, how the skywheel rises! But I wish to see it <hex:021A020203>fall<hex:021A020103>!"
14018,We mustn't let the dolls miss out on the fun!
14019,We've plenty of presents for you...
14020,"Begone, trespassers!"
14021,Something must be done!
14022,For His Royal Headness!
14023,Bow down!
14024,Join us...
14025,How thrilling! How chilling!
14026,"We'll frolic and play, until our dying day!♪"
14027,"Ahaha! Oh, what fun!"
14028,Could that have been─?
14029,"No, it couldn't have... Or <hex:021A020203>could<hex:021A020103> it?"
14030,They said the bastard was dead... Unless...
14031,They were <hex:021A020203>wrong<hex:021A020103>!
14032,"Not afraid of ghosts, eh? Well you <hex:021A020203>should<hex:021A020103> be!"
14033,Good luck! And don't forget the head!
14034,I'm going to enjoy this.
14035,Is that all?
14036,I want to hear you squeal!
14037,Go on! That's the spirit!
14038,What are you waiting for?<hex:02100103>Finish the bastard!
14039,You think...this is the end...?
14040,Alright. Who's next?
14041,"You did it? I mean, you did it!"
14042,The town is saved! Zawtekwa the Undertaken is─
14043,Hm? Where's the body...!?
14044,Not me!!!
14045,
14046,
14047,
14048,
14049,
14050,
14051,No... I cannot fall here.
14052,Haaah!
14053,You'll not escape!
14054,Your blood shall freeze!
14055,"Shiva, aid me!"
14056,0
14057,Ice shall be your tomb!
14058,They will pay for that!
14059,I will not yield!

14075,Hold fast!
14076,Come!

14080,I shall show you something special!
14081,For the honor of House Fortemps!
14082,"Thank you, my friend."
14083,Taste my steel!
14084,I'll run you through!
14085,I have you now!
14086,This ends here!
14087,I must...hold on...
14088,Back to the fray!
14089,"Halone, grant me strength!"
14090,"In Halone's name, I strike thee!"
14091,You'll not escape this!
14092,"Halone, guide my hand!"
14093,"Halone, protect me!"
14094,The Fury smiles upon me.
14095,Unyielding earth!
14096,I call upon the wind!
14097,Take heart─we will prevail!
14098,Come! We've only just begun.
14099,I... I can still fight...
14100,I will not waste this second chance.
14101,This will hurt.
14102,Got you!
14103,That's far enough!
14104,Begone!
14105,Darkness take you.
14106,I am your end.
14107,"Yah, ribbit!"
14108,"Hyah, ribbit!"
14109,"Hyaaagh, ribbit!"
14110,"I feel faint, ribbit..."
14111,"That was a close call, ribbit!"
14112,Haaah!
14113,Yaaah!
14114,I shall make it quick!
14115,Have at you!
14116,"Aether, to me!"
14117,I'll cut you down to size!
14118,Ready or not!
14119,Feel my power!
14120,Graaaaaagh!
14121,It's not over yet!
14122,Again from the top!
14123,Strike true!
14124,To cinders with you!
14125,I hope you like it scorching!
14126,Pulling out all the stops!
14127,"Wreak havoc, my magicks!"
14128,I won't fall here!
14129,Time to turn the tide!
14130,I will pull my weight!
14131,Prepare yourself!
14132,I can do it!
14133,"Trust yourself, and trust your spear!"
14134,"My all, I bring to bear!"
14135,Not good...
14136,We must regroup.
14137,I can dish it out too if needs be!
14138,I never miss an opening!
14139,"Healing winds, bring succor to all!"
14140,There's still fight left in you!
14141,I must hold on!
14142,Not my best showing...
14143,More than I bargained for...
14144,There!
14145,Try this!
14146,No mistakes!
14147,I won't be gentle!
14148,Not so fast!

14165,0
14166,Is there no end to this foul menagerie!?
14167,Best give that a wide berth...

14169,Did those rolling boulders just sprout legs!?
14170,After you. I've an aversion to needles.
14171,Is this...a tomb?
14172,0
14173,Is this a lair or a holding pen?

14177,S-Steady now...

14179,Waaah!
14180,More pests to deal with!
14181,"Courage, Nanamo!<hex:02100103>Quick steps!"
14182,
14183,We must be deep in the heart of the aqueducts...
14184,Not that way.<hex:02100103>The debris is impassable.
14185,What did I do!?<hex:02100103>Did we trip the defenses!?
14186,The sentinels still guard their post...
14187,Remarkable.<hex:02100103>'Tis still in pristine condition...
14188,Aaah!<hex:02100103>W-Was that not the right answer!?
14189,
14190,
14191,For coin and countr─eeeeee!
14192,You seem...amused.
14193,This boulder is wedged in tightly...yes?
14194,REPORT IF DISPLAYED
14195,We must be deep in the heart of the aqueducts...
14196,Not that way.<hex:02100103>The debris is impassable.
14197,Snakes!?<hex:02100103>Why must it be snakes...?
14198,"Well, right or wrong, the door lies open!"
14199,Quite an expansive abode.<hex:02100103>Shall we try upstairs?
14200,REPORT IF DISPLAYED
14201,"Ah, so there <hex:021A020203>are<hex:021A020103> guards..."

14205,This has the look of<hex:02100103>a stage or arena...

14207,Now to see what it was guarding...
14208,0
14209,I find myself drawn to this one...
14210,Onward we go!
14211,"We can walk through this pipe, I think."
14212,Gods. My poor heart.
14213,"All yours, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
14214,
14215,
14216,The path leads on...
14217,A challenge around every corner!
14218,“Two eyes.”<hex:02100103>Is it...metaphorical?
14219,Where have we come to...?
14220,They'll not let us pass without a fight...
14221,What could it possibly mean...?
14222,What are we walking into...?
14223,The path leads on...
14224,"Our respite was short-lived, I see."
14225,The fruit must have drawn them here...
14226,"I wonder, could this be...?"
14227,Why would Mother's familiar be here...?
14228,Still more?<hex:02100103>Every ilm of this place is infested!
14229,"By my strength be healed, Brother!"
14230,"Partake of my strength, Sister."

14234,Let the forest be lush!
14235,'Tis time for respite.
14236,Take your ease among the trees.
14237,"O spears innumerable, rain down upon mine enemy!"
14238,No quarter!
14239,"O spears innumerable, leave naught unpierced!"
14240,"Ahhh, such thrilling battle!"
14241,"Rest easy, Sister. You have done enough."
14242,"Entrust your fate to mine now, Brother!"
14243,Nothing to it!
14244,It certainly kept us on our toes!
14245,Whew... Still standing...
14246,I'm not losing to you again!
14247,This suffering is my strength!
14248,Leave the healing to me!
14249,
14250,
14251,There!
14252,Hyah!
14253,Hah!
14254,Have at you!
14255,Behold the power of the dragoon!
14256,"Halone, guide my blade!"
14257,For Ishgard!
14258,I think not!
14259,I have you now!
14260,Leave this to me!
14261,You won't escape!
14262,To hells with these dragons!
14263,But how...
14264,It can't end...like this...
14265,Mother...
14266,I... I don't want to...
14267,No...
14268,Dammit...
14269,Gah!
14270,Is this...the end...?
14271,"Aether, to me!"
14272,This one'll sting!
14273,Brace yourselves!
14274,Their champion approaches! Make ready!
14275,"If he would taste my lance again, so be it."
14276,Fall back!
14277,"On your guard, Yda!"
14278,"I know, I know!"
14279,I shall make it quick!
14280,"Back, ere we burn to ashes!"
14281,Our foe is formidable. Have care.
14282,No holding back!
14283,Reinforcements!
14284,We will not yield quite so easily!
14285,That'll leave a mark.
14286,Let us end this here and now!
14287,We can't give up!
14288,Now the battle begins in earnest.
14289,Take cover!
14290,Know your folly!
14291,Hmph. This is nothing.
14292,We've come too far to lose now!
14293,It readies to strike!
14294,This is it.
14295,Let's give it our all!
14296,Remember─just as we practiced.
14297,This cavern is strangely beautiful.
14298,An ambush!?
14299,"The door's guardian, no doubt."
14300,Hmph. The coward ran off.
14301,Where has he run off to...? Best we keep on our guard.
14302,He won't escape next time!
14303,"Surely, he's no match for us."
14304,"So, their leader was a Sahagin? An easy victory, then."
14305,There's something unsettling about this place...
14306,I have a bad feeling about this.
14307,We've nothing to be afraid of...right?
14308,We would do well not to disturb the dead.
14309,Careful─another voidsent!
14310,I'll not let you fall. Just focus on the voidsent.
14311,Phew. The altar is clear.
14312,"No matter our foe, so long as we fight as one, we will prevail."
14313,That a body could be so defiled... It's unforgivable!
14314,It's so cool and damp. You would never guess this mine is in Thanalan.
14315,I can't be the only one worried about the mine collapsing...right?
14316,Do you suppose there are any deposits left untapped?
14317,The air is so still. Are we certain there's anyone in here?
14318,"Make ready, everyone."
14319,"A fearsome foe, to be sure, but I don't think it's their leader."
14320,Looks like we'll need more firesand.
14321,"Hm, no firesand. Perhaps there's more in the other room."
14322,"By the Twelve, what is that!?"
14323,"At last, their leader shows himself!"
14324,"Have care, everyone."
14325,We will not yield to the flames!
14326,Such sweltering heat...
14327,"We've not trained for this, but we're ready. I know it!"
14328,Pay no heed to the flames─I will tend to your wounds.
14329,"I like not the looks of that nail. Quickly, we must destroy it!"
14330,I sense a terrible power in that nail.
14331,Something feels wrong about this place...
14332,Another dark and dreary dungeon... Wonderful.
14333,"Gods, would you look at the size of this place."
14334,An ill wind blows through here. Let us hurry and be about our business.
14335,"Careful, everyone. It bears poison!"
14336,Fear not─I will deal with its poison.
14337,Be mindful of its tail!
14338,That tail looks like trouble.
14339,"On your guard, everyone."
14340,This mansion is massive...
14341,I would hate to get lost in here.
14342,Dark forces are at work here.
14343,Perhaps there's something useful in that room.
14344,Do you suppose there's anything useful in that room?
14345,Let's not waste any time with this one.
14346,Their voidsent master has to be here somewhere.
14347,I think we can use this flow of magic to return to the manor entrance.
14348,So the lady of the manor reveals herself at last.
14349,Let us put this wayward soul to rest.
14350,We must hurry and save the goblins.
14351,Let's get going. We have to help them!
14352,Is there really a goblin settlement out here?
14353,Nothing appears out of the ordinary. And yet...
14354,I pray we're not too late.
14355,"With all these beasts lurking about, I hope the goblins are all right."
14356,"Well, that was exhausting."
14357,I was expecting Brayflox to be more...helpful.
14358,Hmph. It flew off...
14359,"Well, at least now the way forward is open."
14360,The dragon! It won't escape this time!
14361,Time to bring low the mountain.
14362,The Lord of Crags... He's much more foreboding in person.
14363,Don't let him unnerve you. Remember your training!
14364,You'll not want for succor. I promise you that.
14365,"The heart is destroyed, but I fear we've only just begun."
14366,Careful─this isn't over yet!
14367,It will take more than a few dragons to stop us.
14368,They really have made a ruin of this place.
14369,Watch your step.
14370,Stay vigilant. These dragons are said to be formidable.
14371,Seven hells. I pray we don't face another of those beasts.
14372,I was certain we were done for after that.
14373,That's the wyvern that's been spouting fire all about the place.
14374,So it was this dragon who set the halls ablaze.
14375,Hopefully we've no more fires to worry about.
14376,We'll need to be careful with this one.
14377,What is this chill in the air?
14378,"Prepare yourself, Garuda!"
14379,Try not to get swept up in her gales!
14380,Fierce winds befitting the Lady of the Vortex.
14381,"Together, we can weather this storm!"
14382,Quickly─take cover!
14383,We can afford no missteps against the Garleans.
14384,I fear my nerves may get the best of me.
14385,"We must watch out not only for soldiers, but magitek as well."
14386,You'll not fall on my watch. Not here.
14387,They will need more than magitek to stop us.
14388,More soldiers. As if the magitek armor wasn't enough.
14389,Stand clear of its arms.
14390,"The tribunus! Stay focused, everyone."
14391,I'll see to your wounds. Just focus on the tribunus!
14392,"Now to find the Ultima Weapon, and shut it down."
14393,"We need but stick to the plan, and all will be well."
14394,Our training has prepared us for this moment.
14395,I'll not let my nerves get the better of me.
14396,Brace yourselves─more magitek!
14397,"You're in good hands, my friends."
14398,This magitek armor should do the job.
14399,Blood crimson... A fitting color.
14400,"His hammer seems cumbersome, to say the least."
14401,We've worked too hard to fail here!
14402,"This ends here, Black Wolf!"
14403,With me! For Eorzea!
14404,This battle demands nothing less than our all!
14405,This is the day we've been training for.
14406,"I will tend to your wounds. Now, go─finish this!"
14407,What is this light...?
14408,The Crystal's Light guides us!
14409,I can feel my strength returning!
14410,We mustn't waste this chance!
14411,Down with you!
14412,Leave the skies to us!
14413,Do not lose heart!
14414,We too can ride the wind!

14422,Aether bends to my will!
14423,Steady now!
14424,We fight to protect our home! To protect Ishgard!
14425,"Let's finish this quickly, shall we?"
14426,Urgh!
14427,Argh!

14429,What in the...?

14433,This bodes ill...
14434,Brace yourselves!
14435,Fall!
14436,"I will see this through to the end. Upon my lance, I swear it!"
14437,The true battle begins here!
14438,We must bring our all to bear!
14439,Commander!

14931,"Pray accept this, my darlings."
14932,"O ring of ice, have mercy upon them!"
14933,Know that I have no love for fighting.
14934,How do you like this?
14935,"Go, Dalamud!"
14936,Grrrrrr!
14937,Woof!
14938,Arruff!
14939,They won't get below deck!

14957,Retreat!
14958,We're not dying here! Not today!
14959,We must find Papalymo and regroup!
14960,Of course it could never be so easy.
14961,Hmm...
14962,Zzz...
14963,Bah! Damned dragons!
14964,A full retreat seems unlikely...
14965,We must hold them here!
14966,Go! Don't worry about us!
14967,Do not let them breach the second ward.
14968,We are in your debt.
14969,We must retreat─now!
14970,We have to protect the last ward!
14971,
14972,Dammit all!
14973,We mustn't lose heart!
14974,We can't outrun them all.
14975,See to the rear guard! Quickly!
14976,Go and cover the rear. We can handle this!
14977,"Thank you, Scions. We will not fail!"
14978,Out of the way!
14979,We're no good to the Holy See dead.
14980,Pull back the artillery! Their champion advances!
14981,Sharp is the lesson!
14982,Fear the gleaming edge!
14983,Unmerciful light shine upon you!
14984,Fury be my strength!
14985,Joyful is your downfall! 
14986,Would you look at all those sunbeards!?
14987,If they catch me shearing one of their siblings...
14988,...they'll swarm for certain!
14989,Whatever am I to do?
14990,"Go on, then! What are you waiting <hex:021A020203>fur<hex:021A020103>? Hah hah hah...sorry. Trapper humor."
14991,"My bushel of sideburns is nigh full, and my belly nigh empty. I reckon it's time I headed home."
14992,Off to the spindles with these splendorous tassels.
14993,The weavers will be clamoring at my doorstep for the best of my worsted!
14994,"First there were <hex:021A020203>too many<hex:021A020103> sunbeards, now there's not a <hex:021A020203>single one<hex:021A020103>. I suppose I'll just have to come back another day."
14995,Blurble gurble...
14996,Groyble!
14997,Grupple brup!
14998,Glurb...
14999,Glurble glabble!<hex:02100103>Glooble glorb!
15000,It's breathtaking.
15001,"Careful, or you might slip and fall."
15002,"This is no time for sightseeing, my friend."
15003,Did the heretics make camp here?
15004,An abandoned camp?
15005,"If they did, they have long since fled."
15006,It's freezing in here.
15007,Is that...an ice golem?
15008,"Surely, the beast is no match for my fire."
15009,"Thal's bloody balls, all that ice..."
15010,I feared I'd slip and break my neck.
15011,Did that goobbue just jump out of a snowball?
15012,Where did <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103> come from!?
15013,Where did it even come from?
15014,Why must the heretics reside in such bitter climes?
15015,"Chin up, friend. Try to think of this as field training... <hex:021A020203>Extreme<hex:021A020103> field training."
15016,Be mindful of its arms.
15017,Hacking through all that fur won't be easy.
15018,"If anyone can pierce that thick hide, it's you."
15019,A snowball fight is not what I was expecting...
15020,I'll have to remember not to underestimate yetis in future.
15021,We must stop the archbishop before it's too late!
15022,"Aye. But nevertheless, we were victorious."
15023,Hm? A dead end?
15024,Perhaps there's a secret passage here somewhere.
15025,"Surely, there's a passage through somewhere."
15026,There they are!
15027,"We need but fight our way through, then?"
15028,We must be careful. I sense a foul aether in the air.
15029,"My, what terrible fangs!"
15030,Would you look at the size of that wolf!
15031,The legendary hoarhound... This is not a foe to be trifled with.
15032,Hmmm. This scaffolding seems sturdy enough.
15033,Curious how the crystal has grown around the debris.
15034,Let's hope there's a clear path up to the top of the wreckage.
15035,"What will we find in here, I wonder?"
15036,"Nothing we cannot handle, surely."
15037,Is that...a bird? It only has one leg.
15038,Something tells me there are more nearby...
15039,I fear we've more than its one leg to worry about.
15040,"For a moment there, I thought they might blow us from the hull."
15041,I dare not ask how they learned to use explosives like that.
15042,"Thankfully, their aim was poor."
15043,"Imperials. I had hoped we could avoid them, alas."
15044,There's no turning back now.
15045,Let's give them what for!
15046,Look there. I think that inductor is powering the barrier.
15047,I like not the looks of that inductor. Best we get rid of it.
15048,Leave it to me!
15049,"Well, I certainly wasn't expecting a gunship."
15050,I'm beginning to grow tired of being struck from the sky...
15051,"Come what may, you'll not want for succor."
15052,I thought it would prove more of a challenge than that.
15053,I pray that was the last of the imperials.
15054,Did I burn it down too quickly for your liking?
15055,"Bah, another aerial assault?"
15056,No time for grumbling─focus!
15057,"Hold on, everyone. We're nearly there."
15058,Are we almost there? I fear my legs may give out soon.
15059,Sounds to me like you need a tougher training regimen.
15060,"Even should our enemy be a great wyrm, we mustn't falter!"
15061,That we should do battle with a great wyrm...
15062,Let us show him the strength of mortal will!
15063,"I feel I've seen this plant's like before, but where...?"
15064,For friends and countrymen!
15065,Drakespur! Beware its pollen!
15066,"Bah, more drakespur."
15067,"Here to delay us, no doubt."
15068,Focus on cutting down the plants. I'll provide support.
15069,There's no time. We must force our way through them!
15070,I didn't come all this way to cut down overgrown weeds...
15071,"Nevertheless, I would see if your lance is suited to the task."
15072,The statues─they're alive!
15073,They would turn the Vault itself against us?
15074,We've still a long way to go.
15075,Then let's keep moving.
15076,Still no sign of the archbishop.
15077,Stop! We did not come here to do battle.
15078,"Forgive me, but we have to defend ourselves."
15079,He cannot be much farther.
15080,Must we always resort to violence?
15081,We must slay or be slain. Make your choice.
15082,Its scales are like unto armor.
15083,Gargoyles!?
15084,A thick hide will not spare it from my lance.
15085,I'd expect nothing less from the Vault's defenses.
15086,"Hmph, it was a worthy adversary."
15087,"We are not here for you to enjoy sport, dragoon."
15088,A knight of the Heavens' Ward!?
15089,"Please, I beg you─let us pass!"
15090,Your words fall on deaf ears.
15091,Ser Adelphel Brightblade!
15092,"If you would flee, now is the time."
15093,And abandon our mission? Don't be absurd.
15094,I like not the sound of that thunder.
15095,These lightning strikes... Are they the work of dragons?
15096,Never mind that. We have to hurry.
15097,Hmph. More lightning.
15098,We must tread carefully.
15099,Your lightning won't save you now.
15100,This dragon was responsible?
15101,Let's keep moving.
15102,"By the gods, we did it!"
15103,This is no time to celebrate─we must keep moving.
15104,They have the advantage here.
15105,"Even so, we must remain calm."
15106,They'll not defeat us through sheer numbers.
15107,"Aye, let us show them the futility of brute force!"
15108,"This one appears stronger than the others, but it matters little."
15109,"This one appears stronger than the others, but it matters little."
15110,I leave the vanguard to you.
15111,Nidhogg is close. I sense him.
15112,<pant> <pant> ...Is it over?
15113,Watch out!
15114,Seven hells!
15115,"We must rout them quickly, ere they overwhelm us."
15116,We shall follow your lead.
15117,"This ends here, Nidhogg!"
15118,Halone grant us strength!
15119,How did he transform into that monstrosity?
15120,"I fear we have little time to ruminate. Come, my friends!"
15121,Ser Grinnaux. I should have known you would be here.
15122,"You bested him once before. Together, we shall do so again."
15123,His title as a knight of the Heavens' Ward is well earned.
15124,"You fought well, my friend, but our mission is far from over."
15125,He means to escape by airship?
15126,We have to hurry!
15127,What sorcery is this?
15128,"Do not be disheartened, my friends. We must give it our all!"
15129,This is nothing...
15130,I can't afford to fall...
15131,It's not over yet!
15132,I'm in your debt.
15133,We've much to do!
15134,You cannot keep me down!
15135,You've forced my hand!
15136,No mercy!
15137,Out of my way!
15138,I will hold nothing back!
15139,I shall carve a path forward!
15140,I am of the first brood!
15141,Are you all right?
15142,Here!
15143,I'll tend your wounds.
15144,Let me to do my part.
15145,Allow me!
15146,This should help!
15147,I will protect you!
15148,My fangs rend all!
15149,We shall see whose rage is the greater!
15150,"Quite literally a twisted place, the void."
15151,Stay focused. Voidsent could be anywhere.
15152,Those ones appear to be sentries.
15153,"Guarding the dungeon, I shouldn't doubt."
15154,Is she the mistress of the castle!?
15155,"Whoever she is, we'll tend to her like the rest."
15156,"Well fought, my friends. Let us press on."
15157,As grand a castle as any I've seen.
15158,"If the mistress is here, we must repay her earlier kindness."
15159,The woman in the painting─do you suppose...?
15160,"Aye, I suspect it's the mistress in bygone days."
15161,"Surprise, surprise."
15162,I sense potent magicks from her. Have care.
15163,"Hmph, she's quick on her feet if nothing else."
15164,She may still be a threat. After her.
15165,Terraces in the sky...
15166,"Do voidsent appreciate flowers too, I wonder..."
15167,We have her now!
15168,I sense something sinister in the air...
15169,It seems he wants to devour us too.
15170,He will find us unappetizing!
15171,Such overwhelming power!
15172,Brace yourselves!
15173,By the Sisters...
15174,That must be the castle proper. Not too shabby.
15175,Be swallowed by the tide!
15176,Brace yourselves!
15177,How do you like this?
15178,I wonder how you'll taste.
15179,"Grrr, why are you still alive!?"
15180,Such overwhelming aether!
15181,"Impressive as always, my friend!"
15182,Wh-What's happening!?
15183,Servants of the gods... I leave them in your hands!
15184,The data collection proceeds apace.
15185,That Nymeia should also descend...
15186,"Ice sculptures? Nay, they're more servants!"
15187,"None the worse for the wear, I hope?"
15188,The same voice from before...
15189,"Be safe, my friend!"
15190,Such a grueling trial that was.
15191,Only one other divinity would abide in the Heaven of Ice...
15192,Caw!
15193,Grooogh!
15194,Your aether will be mine!
15195,I must feed!
15196,"<crick-crack> Come for training, are you?"

15293,You are extraordinary familiars indeed to have endured the trials thus far. This calls for a reward. I do hope you'll like it.
15294,"My, what curious<hex:02100103>familiars you are!"
15295,"Let's play a game! Defeat me, and I'll give you a reward!"

15297,You'd better hurry or I'll get away!

15334,This is over! Surrender!
15335,That was too close...
15336,"And another! In all my years, I've never had so much luck!"
15337,Wait... What's that?
15338,Is something out there looking to snatch my catch!?
15339,"Why, the nerve!"
15340,I fished long and hard to fill that basket. See that it stays full!

15362,"Ugh, I can't fall here..."
15363,I'm in your debt.
15364,No mistakes.
15365,Halone guide my hand!
15366,I will clear the way!
15367,You won't survive this unscathed!
15368,With everything I have!
15369,Everyone is depending on us...
15370,My thanks!
15371,We must stand together!
15372,Down with you!
15373,You underestimate me!
15374,There!
15375,It ends here!
15376,This knight does not yield!
15377,For Ishgard!
15378,It isn't over yet!
15379,I draw upon the canvas of creation!
15380,Behold!
15381,Here goes!
15382,Take that!
15383,Try this!
15384,This should do it!
15385,Out of my way!
15386,You will suffer!
15387,On your knees!
15388,That's far enough!
15389,"Think you're tough, do you?"
15390,Innovation is the key to victory!
15391,Just as I planned!
15392,You'll not lay a hand on my sister!

15404,You okay?
15405,Gahahahaha!
15406,Found you!
15407,◎＃♭▲♪
15408,You must do better<hex:02100103>than that against me!
15409,Choo-choo!
15410,Manderville maaaaaan!
15411,<sigh>
15412,Pray lead the way.
15413,"With pleasure, ribbit!"
15414,"Even at a glance, I see many interesting tomes."
15415,'Tis a pity they had to be abandoned.
15416,Is that supposed to be a grimoire!?
15417,"Yes, but not the kind you want to read, ribbit."
15418,"Everyone hale and whole, ribbit?"
15419,Thank goodness we weren't crushed...
15420,"Watch out, ribbit!"
15421,What a curious familiar...
15422,Is that a treatise on the New World I spy?
15423,"Ah yes, I've read that one. I can recommend it."
15424,"The entrance to the forbidden section is just ahead, ribbit."
15425,Which makes this fellow here the gatekeeper.
15426,I wouldn't have guessed it weak to fire.
15427,"On account of being bound to a tome, I would assume."
15428,An arcane entity that can summon familiars!
15429,The guardians of the forbidden section are a class apart.
15430,Forbidden tomes can certainly assume many forms...
15431,"Master Matoya's tome is at the far end, ribbit."
15432,Yet another guardian...
15433,"Did you ever doubt it? Come, let's finish this."
15434,Falling rocks to add to the danger...
15435,Falling rocks to add to the danger...
15436,Let us proceed with caution.
15437,It's over if we're crushed.
15438,It's over if we're crushed.
15439,We can't lower our guard even in battle.
15440,Is that a balloon on his back!?
15441,Is that a balloon on his back!?
15442,Be on guard for attacks from above!
15443,His tactics were unique to say the least...
15444,His tactics were unique to say the least...
15445,Their mastery of the wind isn't to be scoffed at.
15446,They've fortified the very cave.
15447,They've fortified the very cave.
15448,"An impressive feat, I must allow."
15449,They even have mechanized lifts.
15450,They even have mechanized lifts.
15451,How did they acquire the technology?
15452,Does she mean to rouse the wind with that fan!?
15453,Does she mean to rouse the wind with that fan!?
15454,The knights of our camp have just the defense!
15455,I daresay she was one of the Galeborne.
15456,<pant> Her attacks were a veritable storm...
15457,I daresay she was one of the Galeborne.
15458,An armored troop transport!
15459,An armored troop transport!
15460,A pity my arrows can't pierce them...
15461,We're well and truly in the sky now.
15462,We're well and truly in the sky now.
15463,I can't be back on solid ground soon enough...
15464,We can't allow this summoning!
15465,"Let us prove our worth, my friends!"
15466,"Aye, beyond a shadow of doubt!"
15467,"By the Twelve, it's Chieftain Moglin!"
15468,That he should be part of the trial...
15469,I didn't expect to face the moogles...
15470,I pray they aren't too badly hurt.
15471,<pant> The air is rather thin this high up...
15472,"It isn't a race, so let us pace ourselves."
15473,The wyrm depicted on yonder crest...
15474,Neither Hraesvelgr nor Nidhogg. It could only be Ratatoskr.
15475,A winged horse...and an enormous one at that!
15476,There isn't much room to maneuver. Have care!
15477,That creature was truly fearsome in motion...
15478,Thankfully we managed to rein it in.
15479,"Good heavens, what a majestic place..."
15480,I daresay we are come to Ratatoskr's sanctuary.
15481,"We will win you over, Hraesvelgr. Mark my words."
15482,"What awaits, I wonder..."
15483,"Pray watch over us, Ysayle!"
15484,"All that I have, I shall bring to bear!"
15485,"Stay sharp, everyone!"
15486,"Not foes to be trifled with, Garleans..."
15487,"Stay sharp, everyone!"
15488,"Aye, this is one battle we can't afford to lose!"
15489,Fewer guards this way.
15490,The wall seems to go on forever...
15491,Seems there's fewer of them this way.
15492,Let's clear them out!
15493,You're scrap metal!
15494,That's no armor I've seen before...
15495,That's no armor I've seen before...
15496,Take care around it!
15497,"Right, the outer reaches are just ahead."
15498,We must stay on our toes.
15499,Those claws were no joke.
15500,"Right, the outer reaches are just ahead."
15501,Is that the switch for the platform?
15502,It seems we must ride this platform.
15503,Is that the switch for the platform?
15504,Only one way to find out.
15505,Is it finally over?
15506,"Ugh, if I never see another magitek weapon..."
15507,"Ugh, if I never see another magitek weapon..."
15508,"Sorry to disappoint, but I think there's more."
15509,"Oh, this one's definitely dangerous."
15510,It looks like a spider...
15511,"Oh, this one's definitely dangerous."
15512,"Worry not, I'll tend your wounds!"
15513,I could've done without the swarm of little ones.
15514,"Whew, we did it..."
15515,I could've done without the swarm of little ones.
15516,Those things are relentless...
15517,We're almost to the top.
15518,We've climbed a fair way.
15519,We've climbed a fair way.
15520,There's fighting over on the other side as well.
15521,It's the Griffin's soldiers!
15522,You can't fool us with those uniforms!
15523,It's the Griffin's soldiers!
15524,"If they're here, then that means..."
15525,The Griffin finally shows his face!
15526,We won't let you cause any more harm!
15527,The Griffin finally shows his face!
15528,"Your scheming ends here, you bastard!"
15529,An aetherial path... No simple thing to create.
15530,...Let's keep moving.
15531,"By the Twelve, it's literally upside down!"
15532,The aether is so dense as to be blinding.
15533,"Good gods, what an enormous poroggo!"
15534,They must provide excellent board here.
15535,I pray I never hear that song again...
15536,"Right, into the aether we go."
15537,"Is this it, then? The aetherial sea?"
15538,"This is the shore, you might say."
15539,More homunculi!
15540,We'll deal with them like the rest.
15541,All these spriggans here...
15542,I imagine they were drawn to the crystals.
15543,That was tougher than I expected...
15544,"Come, the lowest level awaits."
15545,Even the candles burn upside down...
15546,How very Sharlayan to obsess over useless details.
15547,"Defenses for the innermost sector, eh?"
15548,Can't lower our guard even for a moment!
15549,Those dolls are the guardians of the viewing chamber?
15550,Have care─I sense tremendous power from them!
15551,<pant> <pant>
15552,These old limbs are limbered up!
15553,"Ohoho!<hex:02100103>Keep running, son!"
15554,This is more like it!
15555,And for your next trick?
15556,This place just keeps getting weirder...
15557,Just about everything is lit up in here.
15558,This place just keeps getting weirder...
15559,"Aye, it's downright uncanny here."
15560,Watch out!
15561,Sentinels!?
15562,Sentinels!?
15563,Such incredible technology...
15564,If it isn't an imperial legatus!
15565,"Hmph, not again!"
15566,If it isn't an imperial legatus!
15567,Nothing we can't handle!
15568,Is that all?
15569,At least he knows when to quit.
15570,Is that all?
15571,It seems he wasn't here for us.
15572,What the hells is that sphere?
15573,I don't like the looks of those tanks...
15574,What do you suppose are in those tanks?
15575,Monstrosities─definitely monstrosities.
15576,Here we go again.
15577,"Ugh, not more abominations..."
15578,Here we go again.
15579,Watch each other's backs!
15580,What a strange-looking...I'm going to go with “thing.”
15581,Some manner of testing ground...
15582,Some manner of testing ground...
15583,"Whatever that thing is, it isn't what it seems!"
15584,Never fought anything like that before.
15585,Clever how it transforms.
15586,Clever how it transforms.
15587,Certainly an efficient way to test creations...
15588,Looks like we're heading down.
15589,Wonder where this will take us.
15590,Looks like we're heading down.
15591,How vast could this facility possibly be?
15592,"I swear, every time you ride a lift..."
15593,We've been found!
15594,"I swear, every time you ride a lift..."
15595,"I know, right!?"
15596,"Oh, that enormous sphere just screams “evil.”"
15597,What could that illuminated place be?
15598,What could that illuminated place be?
15599,"The beating heart of aetherochemistry, perhaps..."
15600,"Here is where the path ends, it seems."
15601,Looks like this is as deep as it goes.
15602,Looks like this is as deep as it goes.
15603,The archbishop must be close.
15604,"It's over, Ascians!"
15605,We won't let you do as you please!
15606,"It's over, Ascians!"
15607,We'll teach you to underestimate us!
15608,How bothersome...
15609,It seems we were right to ride atop the snowcraft.
15610,To arms!
15611,The wildlife here is certainly bold.
15612,It seems we were right to ride atop the snowcraft.
15613,Indeed. Let us hold nothing back.
15614,White as far as the eye can see...
15615,A welcome change of scenery.
15616,I imagine the view from here must be breathtaking.
15617,You can see the Tower of Babil from here!
15618,You can see the Tower of Babil from here!
15619,"And it's no less imposing, even from this great distance."
15620,If this beast would bar our path...
15621,Is this beast native to the mountain?
15622,A veritable giant among the wildlife here to be sure.
15623,If this beast would bar our path...
15624,A simple enough task.
15625,Come. Let us press onward.
15626,"Well, that wasn't <hex:021A020203>too<hex:021A020103> difficult."
15627,There is something to be said for the fortitude of nature.
15628,Come. Let us press onward.
15629,To the cavern!
15630,"How vast is this cavern, I wonder?"
15631,What is this presence...?
15632,"Is it just me, or is the wind blowing warm air?"
15633,So this is Lapis Manalis...
15634,So this is Lapis Manalis...
15635,This is no time for gawping. Watch your step.
15636,The presence of voidsent permeates this place...
15637,The reaper village. Or what remains of it...
15638,A most curious place indeed.
15639,Is this the village Jullus told us about?
15640,The presence of voidsent permeates this place...
15641,I would expect no less from the birthplace of the reaper's art.
15642,Magicked puppets? Here?
15643,"Voidsent, I expected. But puppets...?"
15644,"Despite their menacing demeanor, they're quite charming."
15645,What possessed them to create such automata?
15646,Magicked puppets? Here?
15647,And equipped for combat training. How delightful...
15648,"Come, let us make haste."
15649,That doll was not unlike a voidsent...
15650,"At the very least, it made for good sport."
15651,A masterfully crafted doll.
15652,That certainly was a challenge.
15653,That doll was not unlike a voidsent...
15654,We can muse about that later. Let's get going.
15655,Ugh...
15656,That was quite a fall.
15657,Let us proceed with caution.
15658,"Gods, that startled me."
15659,Is everyone all right?
15660,That was quite a fall.
15661,Thankfully we emerged unscathed.
15662,Azdaja! I sense she is close!
15663,There it is.
15664,"On your guard, everyone!"
15665,There─the voidgate!
15666,So the gate really was here.
15667,There─the voidgate!
15668,"At last, we've found it."
15669,What is it they seek?
15670,This one's not at all like the others.
15671,An archfiend... So this is Golbez's doing.
15672,It looks a lot like the Kojin.
15673,No doubt it is here to guard the gate.
15674,This one seems formidable.
15675,"To be appointed as an archfiend, I should certainly think so."
15676,Is everyone all right?
15677,It will take more than that to stop us.
15678,"Hold fast, everyone!"
15679,Is everyone all right?
15680,Still in one piece.
15681,Flames take you!
15682,Ice bind you!
15683,Now fall!
15684,Flames take you!
15685,Ice bind you!
15686,Now fall!
15687,Graaagggh!
15688,Uraaagh!
15689,GrrrGGGHHH!
15690,Kiiih!
15691,Grrr...
15692,Rrrrrr!
15693,Hisss...
15694,Hissssss!
15695,Earth...
15696,Earth...
15697,Ashes...
15698,Ashes...
15699,Dust...
15700,Dust...
15701,Struggle no more...
15702,Struggle no more...
15703,Were I to chart our course...
15704,I would choose this path.
15705,"The portal, if you would, good sir."
15706,
15707,"Seal of shadow, reveal thy path!"
15708,Excellent! Let us be about it.
15709,Demons already!?
15710,"Well done, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
15711,There is no end to these beasts!
15712,'Tis little wonder the mount was sealed.
15713,<hex:021A020203>No<hex:021A020103>! My climbing attire is soaked...
15714,This is no ordinary windstorm!
15715,Oh dear. They've raided the place!
15716,"Gods, they're everywhere! Have at them!"
15717,How very suspicious.
15718,Oho! The wicked presence is no more.
15719,All this for a dead end...? How odd.
15720,You mean to take to the roof!?
15721,I see the mononoke share your sensibilities!
15722,"Let us head back inside, quickly!"
15723,That battle must have blown out the lights.
15724,Another flight of stairs! Shall we?
15725,
15726,I shall leave the martial matters to you!
15727,I spy a structure in the distance...
15728,"So many horrors, so little time!"
15729,"Why, I feared that would be the end of me!"
15730,This temple is the pinnacle of picturesque.
15731,"More of them? <sigh> After you, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
15732,M-M-Mortals!?
15733,"Nooo! Spare me, I beg of you!"
15734,"Many, many thanks!"
15735,"That way! Oh yes, that way!"
15736,And off it goes...
15737,How dare you! How <hex:021A020203>dare<hex:021A020103> you!
15738,
15739,Would that we had a bit more light.
15740,"“Be careful what you wish for,” and all that..."
15741,I see naught else of note here.
15742,The inner sanctum awaits!
15743,Oho! As I predicted.
15744,Might I suggest you take this elsewhere!?
15745,"I would prefer <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103> to join the fray, thank you!"
15746,Aaaaaaaaaaaah!<hex:02100103>...Oh. Just seedkin.
15747,Shall we continue our hike?
15748,Aha! There's our quarry.
15749,No time to tarry! We've a ways to go.
15750,I believe this is where you come in!
15751,"What lies at the end of the path, I wonder...?"
15752,There's a veritable menagerie on this mountain!
15753,"And just like that, the scenery is ruined!"
15754,You would think they'd have given up by now...
15755,Hmm... Where to go from here?
15756,Courage! Couraaaaaage!
15757,Pray go on ahead...<hex:02100103>I need a moment.
15758,...This is precisely why a life of adventure is not for me.
15759,'Tis as though it's answering! How very polite.
15760,"The result of a landslide, perhaps?"
15761,"A shinobi? And out in the open, at that..."
15762,What is that lodged in the statue?
15763,"Beruru, where are you...?"
15764,They're over there!
15765,Help! Please help my family!
15766,The war must be trying on her too.
15767,"Awww, she's already back in the airship..."
15768,This isn't over.
15769,Hold still!
15770,Back off!
15771,That pillar of light... Is it a geyser?
15772,Let's get moving.
15773,Such an abundance of aether...
15774,The isle proper is within sight.
15775,That building certainly looks the part.
15776,"A Sharlayan facility, and no mistake."
15777,It seems we will not pass here without a struggle.
15778,Fascinating...
15779,What <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> that?
15780,"Lyngbakr, dread beast of the seas."
15781,Land at last!
15782,Mine ears yet ring...
15783,Troublesome creature.
15784,It cometh as no surprise that the vegetation here is eminently lush.
15785,"A convenient mode of transport, that."
15786,This is quite a view.
15787,"Such lines are installed throughout the isle, I believe."
15788,Such vibrant colors.
15789,The isle hath effected a curious change upon yonder golems.
15790,What an eyesore.
15791,There's such a thing as too much aether.
15792,Is that bear from the ice field?
15793,That aether should crystallize upon its very body...
15794,Doesn't look like the type to welcome houseguests.
15795,"Drawn hither by the profusion of aether, I daresay."
15796,No small amount of lightning it harbored.
15797,Just another beast in the end.
15798,Sparking mad.
15799,“Just another”...
15800,Such an overwhelming concentration of aether!
15801,Impressive...
15802,A veritable feast for voidsent.
15803,We are come close enough to see even the finer movements of aether.
15804,I suppose we aim for that massive geyser?
15805,"Aye, there lieth our destination."
15806,You will not stop us!
15807,A squid? Nay...an octopus.
15808,A sizable beast.
15809,This ought to be interesting.
15810,"Though not for want of trying, I suspect."
15811,"That was rather too high for comfort, I must confess..."
15812,Quite invigorating!
15813,There!
15814,Here I go!
15815,In one fell swoop!
15816,Time to end this!
15817,It's nothing personal!
15818,A poor showing...
15819,I'm not finished yet!
15820,Take this!
15821,Here it comes!
15822,"This one's for you, Yda!"
15823,Ready?
15824,Time to get serious!
15825,"Not here, not now!"
15826,I can still fight!
15827,Come no closer!
15828,You shall fall soon enough!
15829,It's all over now!
15830,Let's give them a show!
15831,There'll be nothing left of you but a smoking crater!
15832,I have you!
15833,This blow shall end you!
15834,Look upon a samurai of Doma!
15835,With soul and steel!
15836,Shameful...
15837,Enough!
15838,Out of my way!
15839,"Forward, forward!"
15840,Let us be about it!
15841,Look well and learn!
15842,Concentrate!
15843,Quite unbecoming...
15844,Unyielding as a mountain!
15845,Swift as a steed!
15846,Invigorating as a spring breeze!
15847,By the blessing of the land!
15848,Ugh... Weak as a spent steed...
15849,Grass that is trampled grows back stronger!
15850,Now fall!
15851,The weave of a shinobi's power!
15852,Leave this to me!
15853,This day you die!
15854,I will not be denied!
15855,It...it is nothing.
15856,I won't fall again!
15857,On your guard!
15858,Bear witness!
15859,It's over!
15860,Doma belongs to Domans!
15861,With all my being!
15862,I will not yield!
15863,Forgive me...
15864,"Right, then!"
15865,No holding back!
15866,I will heal your wounds!
15867,For victory!
15868,I cannot fall here...
15869,I will do better!
15870,I'll take care of this!
15871,Oh no you don't!
15872,Rhalgr grant me strength!
15873,With me!
15874,I won't let you down!
15875,Back to the fight!
15876,Here I go!
15877,Swift and sure!
15878,No mistakes!
15879,All or nothing!
15880,For Ala Mhigo!
15881,I'm not finished yet!
15882,"Right, let's try this again!"
15883,Down!
15884,As a raging bull!
15885,The flames rise!
15886,"Roar, Tizona!"
15887,Not bad...
15888,I will redeem myself!
15889,Try this!
15890,Leave it to me!
15891,For A'aba and Aulie!
15892,Down with you!
15893,Getting a bit winded...
15894,Fall!
15895,I hope you like it rough.
15896,Feel the might of the Kraken!
15897,No quarter!
15898,Quite a bind...
15899,Now I'll show you!
15900,You haven't seen anything yet!
15901,Nothing's going to stop us from getting to the Far East!
15902,I'll not suffer troublemakers aboard my ship.
15903,Nothing's going to stop us from getting to the Far East!
15904,Not the most welcoming place...
15905,You need healing!
15906,I shudder to imagine what awaits here...
15907,"If we can punch them, we can deal with them!"
15908,"Well, well, a ghost..."
15909,Let's not waste any time!
15910,"Well, well, a ghost..."
15911,Let's not waste any time!
15912,All fright and no fight.
15913,Is it over?
15914,Is it over?
15915,Far from it. Whatever brought us here wouldn't fall so easily.
15916,That's quite a spectacle!
15917,A gh-ghost ship!?
15918,A gh-ghost ship!?
15919,Quite literally.
15920,Be strong.
15921,S-So long as my spells work...
15922,It appears to have been adrift for a while.
15923,Is that the crew?
15924,Yet another ghost.
15925,Th-That doesn't scare me!
15926,Th-That doesn't scare me!
15927,And so it shouldn't. Ghosts are but men trapped in purgatory.
15928,May the dead know peace.
15929,We...we did it!
15930,We...we did it!
15931,May the dead know peace.
15932,No holding back!
15933,A dungeon!
15934,A dungeon!
15935,It appears this was a prison isle.
15936,I daresay we will soon meet our host.
15937,I-I'm not afraid! M-Merely excited!
15938,I daresay we will soon meet our host.
15939,I-I tremble for the anticipation!
15940,So this is the source of the legend.
15941,Is that the ghost of a siren!?
15942,Is that the ghost of a siren!?
15943,"And the source of the legend, 'twould seem."
15944,So this is the hero's path... Let's prove ourselves worthy!
15945,"This day, we shall be warriors born anew!"
15946,"Hear, hear!"
15947,Nice of them to afford us the chance to limber up.
15948,One test down!
15949,There is no telling what awaits. Let us remain vigilant.
15950,A herd of beasts!?
15951,It appears these beasts are our next test.
15952,No mistaking who the leader is.
15953,That fellow knew how to charge...
15954,That creature was utterly fearless.
15955,"Aye, a warrior in its own right."
15956,That such a place should exist in the Steppe!
15957,You truly get the sense that this is sacred ground.
15958,Indeed! Gives me chills just to be here!
15959,Uwaaah! A golem!?
15960,The stone is alive! What sorcery is this!?
15961,"Whatever it is, it's ingenious!"
15962,What an enormous foe!
15963,Are those seals or hammers in its hands?
15964,Why not both?
15965,"Whew, such a scramble that was..."
15966,Is it over...? My head's spinning something fierce.
15967,It seems that was a test of judgment in the heat of battle.
15968,"After that dip, I'm glad for the warmth of the torches."
15969,"Ahhh, that was refreshing!"
15970,A cavern now... This is turning out to be quite a tour.
15971,A cavernous space behind a portentous gate... This ought to be good!
15972,This bird motif...
15973,I daresay we are come to the yol's nest!
15974,'Twould seem we've reached the path's end.
15975,"This is it, my friends─the final test!"
15976,So that's a yol!
15977,All who bar our way shall taste my steel!
15978,"I am Gosetsu, samurai of Doma─"
15979,Now is not the time to be announcing yourself!
15980,Metal toys will not stop us!
15981,Metal toys will not stop us!
15982,My blade will make short work of this!
15983,This appears to be the guardian of the gate!
15984,This appears to be the guardian of the gate!
15985,Let us end its watch!
15986,On to the inner ward!
15987,On to the inner ward!
15988,"We're coming for you, Yotsuyu!"
15989,Is that your idea of an ambush?
15990,Is that your idea of an ambush?
15991,Have at you!
15992,"Quickly, between barrages!"
15993,"Quickly, between barrages!"
15994,"Ugh, I'm too old for this..."
15995,Another machina to reduce to scrap metal!
15996,An unusual machina...
15997,"Unusual or no, it will fall all the same!"
15998,"Come, let us head inside!"
15999,"Come, let us head inside!"
16000,I pray Lord Hien is safe...
16001,Pretenders! I will not suffer this mockery of ninjutsu!
16002,What? Are they shinobi!?
16003,Naught but pretenders! Our techniques are beyond their ilk!
16004,They deploy machina even inside the castle!
16005,That such a barbaric weapon should defile our beautiful castle...
16006,It will not do so for much longer!
16007,This aura... 'Tis as if he were a beast.
16008,This aura... 'Tis as if he were a beast.
16009,And one with nothing to lose.
16010,"All right, let's raise hells!"
16011,"Aye! The more enemies we can draw, the better!"
16012,They're weapon transport containers.
16013,Best destroy them here and now!
16014,This appears to be a testing facility.
16015,"Well then, let's put this thing through its paces!"
16016,I'm afraid that's a fail.
16017,"A notable mention for its acceleration, however."
16018,Something in those pods...
16019,It couldn't be...people?
16020,That they should so enhance men...
16021,We must shut the pods down!
16022,A third eye... That man is Garlean!
16023,And he's undergone extensive enhancements.
16024,A Garlean who can use magic...
16025,It seems they seek to augment their people's weakness.
16026,Another facility up ahead.
16027,"By the way it's set apart, I'd wager it's important."
16028,They certainly do not want us here.
16029,And that only makes it more inviting!
16030,What is that thing? A machina or a beast?
16031,"Whatever it is, it's dangerous! Have care!"
16032,To the Royal Palace!
16033,I've got you now!
16034,We strike hard and fast like a raging bull!
16035,Sounds good to me! To the Royal Palace!
16036,"They've got some firepower, the Maelstrom!"
16037,"Keep running, we're almost there!"
16038,Commander Rhiki has cleared the way for us!
16039,Much obliged for the help!
16040,The front gate's well defended as you'd expect.
16041,A new type of weapon!?
16042,A new type of weapon!?
16043,"New or old, Tizona will carve a path through it."
16044,The way to the palace is clear!
16045,No problems so far. I hope it's the same for the others.
16046,No problems so far. I hope it's the same for the others.
16047,"We can but have faith and do our part. Come, the palace awaits!"
16048,Look! The others have made it in as well!
16049,This is the moment of truth. Don't get complacent!
16050,"Well, I'll be! We might even have the upper hand!"
16051,This is the moment of truth. Don't get complacent!
16052,"This is for you, Papa!"
16053,Keep moving or you'll be an easy target!
16054,Watch out! Artillery!
16055,"Move it, move it!"
16056,What in the world is that floating chair?
16057,What's a scientist doing here...?
16058,What's a scientist doing here...?
16059,I mislike the look of this... Have care!
16060,Wh-What just happened...?
16061,To so gaze down on myself... A chilling experience...
16062,To so gaze down on myself... A chilling experience...
16063,Never imagined I'd miss my body so much...
16064,As if a little barrier like this can stop us!
16065,We're breaking through! Onward!
16066,A few spells from a distance won't stop us!
16067,We're breaking through! Onward!
16068,Stiff defense they've got here...
16069,The throne room is just ahead. And inside...
16070,Stiff defense they've got here...
16071,Not surprising─the throne room is just ahead.
16072,Zenos! This time we settle this!
16073,You're going down!
16074,"We have you at last, Zenos!"
16075,This time we settle this!
16076,Quaaawk!
16077,<smack> <slurp>
16078,<slurp> <slurp>
16079,Pfff-hssssss!
16080,<clank> <whirr>
16081,Ook-ook!
16082,"Three, two, one...<hex:021A020203>kaboom<hex:021A020103>!"
16083,Hyaaah!
16084,"Woof, woof!"
16085,Shine brilliant for me!
16086,You can't escape the storm!
16087,<squint> <squint>
16088,Arruff.♪
16089,
16090,If it were up to me...
16091,I'd take this path!
16092,They're on fire!
16093,I don't think my fishing hook will be of use here!
16094,I'd rather not do that again...
16095,Get too close and you'll be in for a shock!
16096,Do you think some monsters prefer rainy days over sunny days?
16097,Those claws will cut us in two!
16098,A crab that big could feed a whole village...
16099,I was a bit worried there...but that's behind us now.
16100,More ill-tempered beasts!
16101,We're alive... We're still alive.
16102,It's always worse when they fly...
16103,Go away! Go away!
16104,I said GO AWAY!
16105,Gaaah!
16106,You just going to stand there!? Cold-blooded bastards!
16107,Maybe he shouldn't have set that beast upon us...
16108,There's danger around every bend!
16109,I'll be seeing you!
16110,Not even a word of thanks.
16111,They don't look very friendly!
16112,"Fish are close, I know it!"
16113,To the patient go the fish!
16114,"Oh, what's this? Such a strong bite!"
16115,To the patient go the fish!
16116,"Oh, what's this? Such a strong bite!"
16117,Sorry for wasting your time...
16118,More of them...
16119,Yes! I've hooked something!
16120,"It's weak, but a bite is a bite!"
16121,Oh my! This one's quite strong!
16122,Someone's a fighter! But I won't let you get away!
16123,Those things sent a chill down my spine.
16124,A toad that big could swallow us whole!
16125,I'm glad we didn't end up as its dinner...
16126,Is that...a plant!? It's enormous!
16127,I was afraid you'd be eaten alive!
16128,Ugh... The hairs on my skin are standing on end.
16129,Are those...caterpillars!?
16130,Those rocks...they're moving!
16131,What other surprises does this island have in store?
16132,What a majestic bird...but that beak looks sharp as a sword!
16133,The branches grew!
16134,I've never seen a bat so large!
16135,The bats in Thavnair are not nearly as big...or ferocious.
16136,What are these?
16137,Uwah! How did you─ Leave me alone!
16138,"Finally, statues that stay where they are."
16139,May thoughts of Nidhana give me courage!
16140,Ow! I stubbed my toe!
16141,Oh! I got a bite!
16142,Huzzah! A catch worth celebrating!
16143,How annoying...
16144,May thoughts of Nidhana give me courage!
16145,<heavy breathing> I think that shaved a few summers off my life.
16146,Oh ho! I've hooked something big!
16147,"It's large, and it's heavy!"
16148,Hamsa! They really are everywhere.
16149,I've had my fill of wild animals already...
16150,The tree moves!
16151,I didn't know coconuts could grow to such sizes.
16152,"Look, an asvattha! Just as horrifying here as they are in Thavnair."
16153,"No, even more horrifying...the asvattha here smell much worse."
16154,Let's see. Any fishing spots to be found?
16155,It's a dead end.
16156,Who's that!? Or...what's that?
16157,"My legs don't want to move forward, but I must."
16158,We've walked into a lizard den!
16159,We can go further in from here.
16160,I knew it─a trick!
16161,Why did she get so angry? Was it something I said?
16162,This is no way to treat visitors!
16163,Crocs! Keep your distance!
16164,Where did that faerie fly off to?
16165,Look at the size of that thing!
16166,There has to be a path somewhere...
16167,"<hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>, boars! A lot of them!"
16168,How deep does this path go?
16169,Treasure chests? In a place like this?
16170,Something's not right...
16171,We can't go any further. We'll have to find another way.
16172,They're alive!
16173,That was too close for comfort... Grab the treasure so we can get out of here.
16174,Th-These aren't treasure chests! What do we do!?
16175,"This doesn't look good... I'll leave it to you, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
16176,"This doesn't look good... I'll leave it to you, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
16177,The mist is so thick I can barely see my own trunk...
16178,The mist is so thick I can barely see my own trunk...
16179,"We <hex:021A020203>are<hex:021A020103> going forward, right?"
16180,"A bite, and a strong one at that! I wonder what it is..."
16181,Hmm... That's quite the pull.
16182,Oh!? This might be the big one!
16183,"They want the bait, but not enough to bite down hard..."
16184,"Oh, this is it! Sisters give me strength!"
16185,I'll leave the fighting to you.
16186,Well struck!
16187,All right. Let's keep moving.
16188,Let's go!
16189,Someone help!
16190,Aaahhh!
16191,What has happened to this island?
16192,They leave us no choice...
16193,Are you all right?
16194,"Yes, thanks to you."
16195,There. It should be safe to cross now.
16196,Hold still!
16197,No running off!
16198,Careful!
16199,Yaaaaaargh!
16200,That was too close...
16201,Steady now.
16202,Dammit!
16203,You'll pay for that!
16204,Thank you.
16205,Look out!
16206,Try this!
16207,Nothing to it.
16208,Throw everything you have at it!
16209,Impressive.
16210,What have we here?
16211,What manner of beast could it be?
16212,How large do you suppose it is?
16213,0
16214,"Even so, we should speak with the researchers first."
16215,0
16216,0
16217,Such marks would be too common in any case.
16218,"The beast has feathers, eh?"
16219,So many strange plants you have here.
16220,"Ugh, that smell..."
16221,You said the beast is close?
16222,"Struck down defending its territory, most like."
16223,We mustn't let any more creatures come to harm.
16224,I see no tracks that match those claw marks...
16225,What's this?
16226,There has to be a clue here somewhere...
16227,Focus. We've no time for picking flowers.
16228,A Roegadyn? I thought this island was deserted?
16229,Uwah! Stay away from me!
16230,I need...I need a moment to catch my breath.
16231,For Nidhana!
16232,Hmm... Nothing wants to bite.
16233,A rare catch awaits. I can feel it!
16234,What is he up to!?
16235,Ugh!
16236,"Damn, he's fast..."
16237,Hngh!
16238,My turn!
16239,Bleed!
16240,Come on!
16241,Hyah!
16242,Fall already!
16243,Hah!
16244,Saw that coming.
16245,Now!
16246,Not this time!
16247,<squeak>
16248,Squeeeaaak!
16249,Wreeeeee!
16250,Let's get started!
16251,Hope you brought an umbrella!
16252,Have you ever beheld such grace as mine!?
16253,Phew...I'm going through a lot of bullets.
16254,Oh no! My finger slipped!
16255,Here. We. GO!
16256,"Run, run, run!"
16257,Hahaha!
16258,You'll never guess what I've got in store...
16259,Hehehe! Who made that sound? Rude! 
16260,Just step on a cushion! Pretty please?
16261,Time to reload!
16262,This scenery reminds me of home...
16263,"Gaaah! I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid..."
16264,Remember... Hardships make us strong!
16265,This looks like a great spot to cast my rod.
16266,Hmm... Not a single fish I haven't seen before.
16267,I'll have a look!
16268,Too bad!
16269,"Heh, lucky you."
16270,"What was in the chests, I wonder?"
16271,See how an expert fisher does it!
16272,It's beautiful...
16273,"Good to see you found a way in too, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>."
16274,"Right, then! Let's go and get our treasure!"
16275,"Up for some spearfishing, J'moldva?"
16276,Always.
16277,What is that? Some kind of horse?
16278,It's the Kelpie! I've heard legends of it!
16279,I'm drenched from head to toe...
16280,"No more than you'd expect on an adventure, eh?"
16281,And I have a feeling it's crawling with “worshipers”...
16282,I daresay this was a place of worship.
16283,"Quite well guarded, that door."
16284,Does that mean we've already reached the treasure!?
16285,"If that's the treasure, then consider me disappointed."
16286,"Fortunately for you, it's another guardian. Be on your guard!"
16287,"Hmph, troublesome piece of clay..."
16288,Indeed. Its magicks were not to be underestimated.
16289,Prison cells...
16290,Relics of the mad king's reign.
16291,That was a person? Seven hells...
16292,So the dark rumors of this place were true...
16293,It seems that fellow won't let us have the treasure without a fight.
16294,"Wouldn't be much of an adventure if it didn't end on a climax, eh?"
16295,I...can't move...
16296,From here we must proceed on foot.
16297,That was quite a sandstorm...
16298,All present and accounted for?
16299,I believe so. Let us continue on foot.
16300,"Watch your heads, everyone!"
16301,The sand above gives way. Have care.
16302,Falling rocks!
16303,We've fallen quite a ways...
16304,A scorpion clad in crystal. How curious.
16305,I daresay we're in that creature's home.
16306,What did it have to feed upon here?
16307,Amazing that life could adapt to such a harsh environment.
16308,One cannot underestimate the will to survive.
16309,Is this Allagan...?
16310,Quite an abrupt change in surrounds...
16311,Aye. The aether here is unmistakable.
16312,"Ugh, repulsive creatures..."
16313,It seems we've trespassed upon their lair.
16314,Never a dull moment in this cavern!
16315,"Native fauna or Allagan machina, we'll clear them all out!"
16316,Such an immense facility...
16317,Both machina and facility are still operational.
16318,"Not for much longer, they won't be!"
16319,Those blades could do some serious damage.
16320,Nothing to it.
16321,"As much as I would like to examine this place, we should press on."
16322,Indeed. Perhaps there will be time later.
16323,'Tis easy to see why they say this place was “bled dry.”
16324,"No matter the odds, life always finds a way..."
16325,The sand here is as pale as those enormous bones.
16326,I'm glad we don't have to face it alive.
16327,"Are sandworms descended from this creature, I wonder."
16328,That a sandworm could have grown to such proportions...
16329,A dragon as white as these wastes... How very fitting.
16330,That dragon formed from the mist!
16331,"Another of Allag's pitiable slaves, I'd wager."
16332,"This is the moment of truth, my friends! Hold nothing back!"
16333,"Aye, let's give them hells!"
16334,They must do better than that to catch us off guard!
16335,Out of our way!
16336,Enemies from above!
16337,Golden armor... Safe to assume it's dangerous.
16338,"Special, are you? Well, you're about to lose your luster!"
16339,Indeed. Let all have care.
16340,"Ungh, my head is spinning..."
16341,That was some truly savage swordplay.
16342,Too close for comfort...
16343,How fierce must the fighting have been here...
16344,Machina wreckage!?
16345,Our friends need us! With me!
16346,"Hang in there, Lyse!"
16347,My lord!
16348,An unusual foe...but we will find a way through it!
16349,"Whatever it is, we can't afford to be stopped here!"
16350,Some manner of trench-digging weapon?
16351,Such bizarre machina the Garleans are wont to make...
16352,"That one was like a fire-breathing mole, I thought."
16353,Elder Seedseer! Ser Aymeric!
16354,Let us press on together!
16355,How heartening to have the Alliance's finest at our side!
16356,"You're all safe, thank goodness!"
16357,"Aye, there is naught we need fear!"
16358,To ward off such a powerful attack...
16359,No less than I'd expect of the Elder Seedseer!
16360,A sturdier barrier I have seldom seen!
16361,Leave it to Lyse to pierce warmachina armor with her fist!
16362,I won't be outdone!
16363,These are no ordinary soldiers...
16364,"So, their commanders deign to appear at last!"
16365,Make way for Zozone!
16366,Ride the wind!
16367,Serve up a storm!
16368,Time to make myself scarce!
16369,Heartless bastards! I'll have my revenge!
16370,Shame I won't get to watch you die here!
16371,It's gone berserk!
16372,Does every beast on this island want to kill us?
16373,"I admit...that was scary, but exciting."
16374,Have at you!
16375,Enough!
16376,Fear my wrath!
16377,I think not.
16378,"With me, Golbez!"
16379,Are you all right?
16380,For king and country!
16381,I cannot─will not─fall here!
16382,It's Lord Golbez!
16383,Lord Golbez is come!
16384,And Lord Durante too!
16385,Thank heavens you've returned!
16386,Arrrggghhh!
16387,Help...me...
16388,Lord Golbez! Lord Durante!
16389,"Quickly, to the castle!"
16390,They've returned! Thank heavens!
16391,"Lord Golbez! Hope is not lost, then!"
16392,"Please, no!"
16393,What's happening to me!?
16394,Run for your lives!
16395,Ahhh!
16396,Someone help us!
16397,Peep-peep!
16398,Sssquidge?
16399,<rumble> <rumble>
16400,Wind guide my arrow!
16401,...
16402,"Work hard, play harder!"
16403,I shall deliver the<hex:02100103>world its salvation!
16404,Ruff!
16405,Woo-hoo-hoo!
16406,"Peg, peg!"
16407,Hyaaah!
16408,Darkness...
16409,Are you prepared?
16410,You don't need a reason.
16411,Please come back.
16412,<slurp>
16413,0
16414,One!
16415,Two!
16416,Three!
16417,Four!
16418,Five!
16419,Six!
16420,We will deal with this fiend!
16421,Forward! Forward!
16422,For Baron!
16423,Leave this one to us!
16424,Allow me to assist you!
16425,Let us press onward!
16426,We must hurry to the castle!
16427,The city is in ruins...
16428,Onward!
16429,I shudder to think what other horrors yet await us.
16430,I leave the rest to you.
16431,"Hurry, Golbez!"
16432,What in the seven hells!?
16433,Wh-What's happened to my body?
16434,"Ye gods, what magick is this!?"
16435,"Grrr, just you wait!"
16436,A truly vexing spell...
16437,"Ugh, not again!"
16438,Don't take your eyes off them!
16439,This can't be good... Stay on guard!
16440,You'll not find me an easy target!
16441,So they mean to play their trump card!
16442,Throw everything you've got at them!
16443,We must finish this before they can!
16444,0
16445,What's gotten into this thing!?
16446,Try aiming for its wings!
16447,One step at a time...
16448,"Oh, you ruined it! I'd packed the chests full of goodies, too!"
16449,You aren't going to jump...are you?
16450,I can do this! I can!
16451,Every twist and turn brings us face-to-face with a new threat...
16452,"Finally, a chance to fish!"
16453,"Do you think she's telling the truth, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>?"
16454,"Look at this, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
16455,Huh!? What is this fish?
16456,The slightest touch should be enough to clear it...
16457,The wind made it brittle for us. Now we can pass through!
16458,Let us reconvene at the castle garden.
16459,Let's hope the divinities of Aloalo guide us true.
16460,Nothing for it but to keep going!
16461,We made it through the mist!
16462,What!? It moved!
16463,"Didn't expect that. Well, no point in sticking around!"
16464,Yaaaaaahhh!
16465,I almost fainted... Where are we?
16466,"Everywhere we go, beasts are waiting for us!"
16467,These caterpillars are blood-curdling...
16468,It's quicker than it looks!
16469,Hehe. Now this could be interesting.
16470,"I won't say no to treasure, but what I'm really here for is the fish!"
16471,"Golbez's domain, at long last..."
16472,So there are voidsent after all. Have care.
16473,This place is not at all as I remember it...
16474,"He's altered his domain, then?"
16475,I can sense its presence deep within... Zeromus is here.
16476,"Let's move on, before they have time to regroup."
16477,Teleportation magick. Interesting...
16478,Is this all Golbez can muster to bar our path?
16479,I didn't expect such a beast to yet remain.
16480,A formidable foe...
16481,"Even so, it pales before the archfiends."
16482,The vanishing scepters were quite the nuisance.
16483,That was easy enough.
16484,As if cheap parlor tricks would suffice to stop us.
16485,"Vanished, you say? I thought they were merely bluffing."
16486,A memoria crystal!?
16487,"This memoria crystal is... No, it can't be..."
16488,What's happening!?
16489,Did that man just call you...Golbez?
16490,I've met this man somewhere before...
16491,This man seems to think you're Golbez.
16492,'Twould seem we've become part of the memory.
16493,"Whoever this man is, he seems convinced you're Golbez."
16494,"They were too late to save their home, then..."
16495,So this is the kingdom of Baron.
16496,"Even if this is only a memory, it is no less easy to bear and watch."
16497,"If we're to escape, it seems we've no choice but to fight."
16498,Are those fangs...or horns?
16499,So this is an antlion of the Thirteenth.
16500,We should follow after him.
16501,Is there no end to this memory?
16502,"For a mercy, its movements were easy to read."
16503,I'm sure this was a beautiful castle once...
16504,Such tragedy was commonplace during the Contramemoria...
16505,Who could be behind all this?
16506,Such carnage. Such cruelty. This is...
16507,The Contramemoria...
16508,We must find a way across.
16509,That he should place such faith in Golbez...
16510,Let us leave the other side to him.
16511,"In any case, it would be rude of us not to respond in kind."
16512,They've all but brought the Final Days upon themselves.
16513,They've been turned into monsters!
16514,An irreversible transformation...
16515,Such terrible strength...
16516,He gave himself to the Dark to stop Golbez...
16517,On your guard!
16518,It seems we've no choice but to fight...
16519,"And yet it falls to us to keep him─or rather, you─from harm."
16520,Fill their lungs with water!
16521,Drown them and be done with it!
16522,I can't take any more of his pestering.
16523,How could something so large move so quickly!?
16524,0
16525,Enough!
16526,"I try to only speak kindly of others, but they test me..."
16527,"I try to only speak kindly of others, but they test me..."
16528,So many regulators... They all used to belong to someone...
16529,"Not the best camouflage, now is it?"
16530,"Ahaha, so only intruders can bust in through the front!"
16531,The conveyor's been activated. We can continue up.
16532,Looks like they knew we were coming...
16533,"This won't be comfortable, but intruders can't be choosers."
16534,They're headed up...but where do we go from here?
16535,This has the look of a research laboratory...
16536,It's quiet. <hex:021A020203>Too<hex:021A020103> quiet...
16537,
16538,Princess Sphene!
16539,I'm going to become a knight and protect the princess!
16540,“Service Eternal”... She truly lives by her words.
16541,We all of us must do our part for the kingdom.
16542,"Blessings be upon you, Your Highness!"
16543,It's so uplifting just to see and hear Her Highness.
16544,Long live Princess Sphene!
16545,"Even with all her duties, she makes time for us."
16546,I'm going to enjoy this!
16547,Ugh! I can't move!
16548,You're a lifesaver!
16549,Such power...
16550,Blades of fire rain.
16551,Go forth!
16552,Heh. Overbearing bastard.
16553,These blades sundered Valigarmanda's scales!
16554,Promise!
16555,We'll get through this!
16556,
16557,
16558,
16559,Huh!? I-I can't move!
16560,These flames...
16561,Thanks! I owe you one.
16562,You have my thanks.
16563,Ugh!
16564,Argh!
16565,Take that!
16566,Gahahahaha!
16567,What a chore...
16568,
16569,
16570,
16571,I have your back.
16572,Perhaps this will help.
16573,You're not alone!
16574,I shall assist thee.
16575,
16576,
16577,
16578,
16579,Tch!

16603,"Nyipine, Father... I'm so sorry..."
16604,"Ready, Pana? The road awaits!"
16605,Mrrrn... Pfffbt!♪
16606,That's the spirit! They'll be inviting us to join a caravan any day now!
16607,Thbbbpt!
16608,Aaagh! What in the─!?
16609,Mrrrn!?
16610,We'll find help! Stay strong until we return!
16611,Mrrrnnn!
16612,Forgive the delay─I've brought sellswords!
16613,"Wait, you've already defeated it!?"
16614,"Incredible! Oh, thank the gods it didn't reach the village..."
16615,Our community is in your debt!
16616,Patchoo!♪
16617,We've made good progress. What say we rest here?
16618,Fine by me. I'm sure our alpacas would appreciate a break.
16619,Mrrrn...
16620,Pfffbt.♪
16621,Hmm... Perhaps we overfilled our wagons this trip.
16622,Nonsense! Think of the profits we'll rake in when we get there!
16623,Hrnnn... Hrrrmmm!
16624,Huh? What's gotten into them all of a sudden?
16625,"Oh gods, look! Wolves!"
16626,Mrrrnnn!
16627,Protect the supplies!
16628,"Away with you, beasts!"
16629,Thbbbpt!
16630,Patchoo!
16631,Thank you so much for driving them off.
16632,Now to get these supplies home!
16633,Perhaps we'll see you around sometime.
16634,"May fortune favor you, traveler!"
16635,Hum...♪
16636,Thbbbpt!
16637,No! The supplies!
16638,Leave them! Our lives take precedence over profit!
16639,Mrrrnnn...
16640,Pfffbt!
16641,"Have care, traveler!"
16642,We are in your debt!
16643,The citizens... This is horrible...
16644,The way's blocked!
16645,It's gone!?
16646,We're good to go!
16647,We'll clean them all out!
16648,This is awful...
16649,How terrified you must have been...
16650,Excellent! Let's press on!
16651,This saves us a detour.
16652,Heeelp!
16653,Ugh...
16654,No...
16655,I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
16656,Look! Survivors!
16657,Let's check on them.
16658,You're safe now!
16659,Are you alright?
16660,Oh no...
16661,Watch out!
16662,"We won't give up, Your Majesty!"
16663,Aye! We'll get through this!
16664,It's not over till it's over!
16665,
16666,
16667,They should be fine here.
16668,Let's press on!
16669,I...cannot move...
16670,
16671,You came!
16672,We must hold them off!
16673,More of them!
16674,Confound it...
16675,For honor!
16676,We will not fall!
16677,Feel the sting of my blade!
16678,We need to spread out!
16679,"Everyone, gather close!"

16714,GHOSTS!
16715,Uwaaah!!! RUUUN!
16716,"Sorry, I'll get out of your way!"
16717,"Please, protect their memories."
16718,"If the glyphs are lost, our ancestors will die!"
16719,Alas...
16720,We must repair them at once.
16721,Excellent work. The wind sprites have settled.
16722,"Thanks to you, the glyphs are undamaged."
16723,Now we need but hope the Stormrider won't show itself.
16724,"It appears I spoke too soon! Save yourself, outsider!"
16725,"To protect my family, I shall bring my all to bear!"
16726,Ahhh... A dip in the hot springs is just what I needed.
16727,"Soothing, isn't it? I feel so...toasty!"
16728,Pfffbt.♪
16729,Mrrrn!
16730,"You know, this could be our final moment alive..."
16731,"Oh, please. That old wives' tale doesn't scare me."
16732,Someone save us!
16733,Gods help me─the Pelu eater is real!?
16734,Mrrrnnn!
16735,Hummm!
16736,"Scythe in hand, into the fray,<hex:02100103>Sally is here to sweep you away!"
16737,Engaging housekeeping protocol!
16738,"Dust and dirt, muck and grime,<hex:02100103>this is where Sally draws the line!"
16739,Encountering resistance!<hex:02100103>Loading reversal protocol!
16740,Engaging reversal protocol!
16741,So much for a tranquil boat ride!
16742,I knew it...
16743,He was waiting for us!
16744,Gehehehe!<hex:02100103>Enjoy our present!
16745,Afraid of a fair fight!?
16746,The harness!
16747,I can't command the punutiy like this...
16748,Seems Bakool Ja Ja got his way...
16749,"We have to mend this damage.<hex:02100103>If you could help me, Alisaie...?"
16750,Of course.<hex:02100103>Whatever you need.
16751,None can compare to the Resilient Son!
16752,The First Promise was born to sit the throne!
16753,He will be a great Dawnservant!
16754,"Come along, Pana! It's time for a stroll!"
16755,Mrrrn... Pfffbt!♪

16762,Souls are being extracted from regulators...
16763,"The glowing things─they're souls, all of them."
16764,"According to Elene'shpya, we continue through here."
16765,The souls are being cleansed prior to storage...
16766,I see... This is where they researched the use of feral souls!
16767,<blip> <bloop>
16768,Haha! You're no match for our magitek!
16769,For freedom!
16770,Crush them!

16772,Th-There's nothing to be afraid of!
16773,In the name of Chalteaufite!
16774,Hope you like missiles!
16775,Ungh... It's the blessing!

16960,We were attacked...?
16961,"Still alive, I see! Then play a game with me─the very last one of your lives!"
16962,"You like cards, don't you? Everyone likes cards! Remember the numbers on each one─if you forget in the game, you die in real life!"
16963,"The number of acorns will decide your fate. Remember them, or else!"
16964,It's time to draw a card! Fire up those tired brains of yours!
16965,"Now, which card did I draw first? Choose wisely, for your lives depend on it!"
16966,"Oh my! Survivors!? Well then, that means it's time to draw even more cards!"
16967,Here I go! I wonder what I'll draw first?
16968,Now for card number two...
16969,"And finally, the third one! What do you think it'll be?"
16970,Do you remember which card I drew first? Or are your wits as slow as your feet?
16971,"Which card did I draw second? If you tire of living, wrong answers are gladly accepted!"

16981,Unable to proceed with our patrol under current conditions. We must develop another strategy...

16999,Damaged sentries have been discovered in this area. Requesting support...

17022,You'll regret this!
17023,Thanks for driving those bandits away!
17024,"The parcels are safe, and so are we!"
17025,Time to gather up our inventory and head back to town.
17026,You have our thanks!
17027,Hrrmmm!

17031,Swipe the gold and valuables!
17032,I hope those peddlers were carryin' somethin' to eat!

17085,Unbelievable...
17086,Gah!<hex:02100103>They're coming from below!
17087,He's watering the seeds with aether...
17088,Is he...dancing!?
17089,Look out!<hex:02100103>They're much bigger now!

17093,The mimics from before...
17094,Ew! He's spat something up!

17096,They've copied us again!
17097,"Oh my, that is unsettling..."
17098,We've got pumas coming in!
17099,They don't seem interested in us...
17100,"After a rival predator, it seems."
17101,It's <hex:021A020203>eating<hex:021A020103> them!
17102,Everything is food to this creature...
17103,Such ferocity!
17104,Careful!<hex:02100103>It's much faster now!
17105,It must take the qualities of its prey!
17106,Because it fed!?
17107,Now what?<hex:02100103>Giant worms!?
17108,They were burrowing beneath us!
17109,It's one thing after another!
17110,"Ugh, it's feeding again!"
17111,Ware its adaptations!
17112,Its appetite is endless...
17113,This way!
17114,It froze its friends!?
17115,They've stopped moving...
17116,"Big ones, little ones...<hex:02100103>The whole family is here!"
17117,Look at them all...
17118,We can handle it!
17119,What kind of bird can do that!?
17120,The shards are resonating with its magic!
17121,Did you see that?<hex:02100103>The spell came from the crystals!
17122,Ugh...getting hard to move...
17123,Is this how it hunts?
17124,We're being crystallized!
17125,We'll face whatever he throws at us!
17126,Careful! This is powerful magic...
17127,Some kind of arcane tablet?

17129,0
17130,Everyone all right!?
17131,Well enough...<hex:02100103>Let's get back to it!
17132,Time to go on the offensive!
17133,"Well, that's one way to fight."
17134,That was close!
17135,Was that a blade just now?
17136,Such speed...
17137,They mean to drop bombs on us?
17138,Above us!

17144,I mustn't let everyone down...
17145,So the attacks are coordinated...
17146,Whoops!
17147,Ha! Nice try!
17148,"Peculiar technology, to be sure..."
17149,I see─the attacks reflect!
17150,"Once we determine a pattern, we can avoid its attacks."
17151,We have more to be wary of now...
17152,Pardon me!
17153,Again!?
17154,"Watch out, everyone!"
17155,That was a close one!
17156,Th-The sheer force it's mustering!

17159,"Dodge its attacks, then resume the offensive!"
17160,"Get caught in that, and you're done for..."
17161,What immeasurable strength!
17162,Do they <hex:021A020203>really<hex:021A020103> need so many weapons?
17163,All we have to do is dodge. Easy...right?
17164,What manner of weapon is this?
17165,Careful! It makes ready to strike!
17166,What now?
17167,I'd rather not get shocked if I can help it.
17168,The air is thick with lightning aether.
17169,Careful not to touch those barriers.
17170,Argh! Enough already!
17171,These bubbles...!
17172,"Everyone, keep your focus!"
17173,Prioritize evasive measures!
17174,"Ugh, disgusting..."
17175,A veritable shower of poison...
17176,I'm glad I practiced dodging.
17177,I shudder to imagine being covered in that.
17178,We did it!
17179,What!? But how!?
17180,Welcome to Yesterland! The long wait is finally over!
17181,For the parade of mascots is soon to begin! Join us in our revelry─you won't regret it!

17190,Many thanks! This is more than enough!
17191,"Without materials, my repairs will have to wait..."
17192,Those moles left the ruins manyholed and tunnelfilled!
17193,Mobbie senses goodly earthgifts on the surface ripe for the taking!
17194,"Excellent seeksearching, outlander!"
17195,What a disappointment... No soundsleeps for Mobbie tonight...
17196,"Hah hah hah, splendid! March on, my friends, march on!"
17197,"Oh my, it appears that while the spirit is willing, the body is weak. It seems our parade must come to an end... Perhaps the next one will be more lively!"
17198,"Although today's parade may be over, rest assured we will return..."
17199,They better not come this way...
17200,Our precious parcels...
17201,Spatchoo!

17216,The parade shall continue forevermore! All are welcome!
17217,"In a life eternal, we grant a moment of death! Savor it!"
17218,Feel your life glow bright!
17219,Hohoho!
17220,Life itself marches to the beat of the parade!
17221,"Thank you, one and all, for joining our parade!"
17222,"I'm afraid to say that our march must come to an end. However, we will return─of that you can be certain!"
17223,I suppose Mica did not deign to appear...
17224,"Thank you, one and all, for joining in our parade!"
17225,I'm afraid the festivities must come to an end. But we will meet again soon─of that you have my word!
17226,I wonder if Mica is ready...?
17227,The clearing is full of nastyshrooms!
17228,They mean to dirtymake our precious craftclay!
17229,Restore the grove to peacefultimes!
17230,Too many mushrooms! Bagnobrok will leave fightyhurts to the outlander!
17231,The mushrooms are no more! Bagnobrok is filled with joysmiles!
17232,The craftclay is saved!
17233,"But an oddscent hangs in the air. From the mushrooms, perhaps?"
17234,This bodes unwell...
17235,"A huge, hulking angrybeast! Best for Bagnobrok to run away."
17236,The mushrooms are still sporestrong... What will become of the craftclay?
17237,"Time to go and gather helphands! Be safe, outlander!"
17238,You're finished!
17239,Does he ever run out of mammets!?
17240,"Oh, dear... Run, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
17241,What in the hells are you doing!?
17242,"C-Call them off! Call them off, dammit!"
17243,Aaah!
17244,...Oh.
17245,If you insist...
17246,0
17247,"My festive Endless, welcome to the final stretch of our macabre march!"
17248,"By popular demand, we have invited a very special guest! Brace yourselves for a fantastic show!"
17249,Give a hearty round of applause for Mica the Magical Mu!
17250,"Let your flickering life shine bright, one last time!"
17251,"I hope you enjoyed the show! And with that grand finale, our march must come to an end!"
17252,"Thank you, one and all, for taking part! Although your legs may be tired, do take care on your way home!"
17253,That one! That's the real Ellerete!
17254,Return the Heartsting─<hex:021A020203>now<hex:021A020103>.
17255,We must retreat before it's too late...
17256,And that marks the end of our parade! I hope you enjoyed Mica's grand display!
17257,Very rarely are we offered a taste of death. I only hope you drank deep while you could!
17258,"And if you feel unsatisfied, rest assured we shall meet again. For this parade is eternal!"
17259,Not good─we need to spread out!
17260,D-d-don't you think we've come far enough?
17261,"You're not <hex:021A020203>still<hex:021A020103> scared, are you?"
17262,N-n-n-no! It's just... It's just... Did you hear something?
17263,Not this again! I told you there's no such thing as─
17264,GHOST!
17265,RUUUN!
17266,Here they come! Are you ready?
17267,I hope so!
17268,Looks like we're outnumbered...
17269,Not that I'm scared or anything.
17270,Lights out!
17271,I'd say it's time for a tactical retreat...
17272,"I'd say that was mission accomplished, then!"
17273,"We contractors have to stick together, eh?"
17274,Error... Error...
17275,Threat assessment: high.<hex:02100103>Bypassing safety protocols.
17276,That swarm is getting closer.
17277,You think it'll attack?
17278,"It's not a question of if, but when."
17279,Then how will we hold the tower? There's only two of us!
17280,Hyah!
17281,Hrah!
17282,Come on!
17283,"Die, will you!"
17284,"Thanks to you, the tower still stands."
17285,At least until the next swarm comes.
17286,Dammit! There are too many of them!
17287,We can't stay here any longer!
17288,Dammit! I'm almost out of souls!
17289,Error...<hex:02100103>Rebooting geolocator...
17290,I'll be back as soon as I can. Good luck.
17291,I'm back! Now where are the blood-sucking bastards!
17292,"Oh... Well, I hope you don't think I was just waiting for you to finish now... Heh heh."
17293,"I...uh, suppose then I should be heading back. Thanks again, traveler!"
17294,<labored breathing>
17295,That was the last of my soul reserves...
17296,Then we'd best start praying...
17297,Mew!
17298,Zoooooom!
17299,Ptui!
17300,<slurp> <slurp>
17301,Baaaaaa!
17302,<lick> <lick>
17303,Peep! Peep!
17304,Aroooooo!
17305,Rororrlololo～♪
17306,<rustle>
17307,<flex>
17308,Meow.♪
17309,Arise!
17310,Ta-da!
17311,Tee hee hee!
17312,<clink> <clank>
17313,Yaaarrrgh!
17314,Try this!
17315,We <hex:021A020203>will<hex:021A020103> prevail!
17316,I've been waiting for this...
17317,"Another day, another commission of paramount importance..."
17318,I'll pump you full of lead!
17319,Time for you to bite the bullet!
17320,You're mine!
17321,Hand over your money!
17322,Tear 'em apart!
17323,Hyah!
17324,Run? Seemed to work well for you last time.
17325,"Everyone? It is now, unless you have a pair of Lalafells in your pack."
17326,And just what are we supposed to do if that <hex:021A020203>thing<hex:021A020103> shows?
17327,Is this─
17328,"Should we turn back, then?"
17329,And return without our quarry?
17330,Better than without our heads!
17331,Barely! What do you think the elders will do when they see us empty-handed?
17332,We could always try and find someone to join us...
17333,And let them take all the glory?
17334,Tell me again how much glory we've accumulated so far?
17335,Are you three finished?
17336,<grunt>
17337,For glory!
17338,Hrah!
17339,Ngrah!
17340,After them!
17341,Aye!
17342,Is that what I think it is?
17343,Do you think it's a giant weasel? Then yes. It's <hex:021A020203>exactly<hex:021A020103> what you think it is.
17344,I knew this was a bad idea...
17345,"Too many of them, and far too few of us."
17346,<pained groan>
17347,Maybe <hex:021A020203>now<hex:021A020103> we can head back?
17348,The blade of Kirlirger is unrivaled!
17349,You still live!?
17350,No...I refuse! DIE!
17351,0
17352,0
17353,How could this happen!?
17354,What the hells!?
17355,On your guard!
17356,Charge!
17357,You've nowhere to run!
17358,Take this!
17359,You don't stand a chance!
17360,I'm no match for Kaqool Ja!
17361,Unghhh...
17362,What happened to the blessing!?
17363,"Don't know how many are left out there. You'd best get to safety, too, while you can."
17364,M-My body...
17365,Ugh... How is this possible...?
17366,
17367,<pant> <pant>
17368,Catch me if you can!
17369,Irregular organism has been detected. 
17370,Commencing extermination protocol.
17371,Our current strength is insufficient. We require reinforcements...
17372,The extermination was a success thanks to external support.
17373,"All units, cease combat maneuvers and return to base."
17374,We have failed to contain the organism.
17375,We must withdraw and form a new strategy!
17376,I told you. Didn't I tell you?
17377,The glory's all yours!
17378,Whose idea was this anyway?
17379,I'm not dying here today!
17380,Find cover!
17381,Mission accomplished. Thank you for your assistance.
17382,"Spread out, spread out!"
17383,"Initiating self-destruct protocol, that's what!"
17384,We did it! We actually did it!
17385,The elders aren't going to believe this.
17386,They'll believe it when they eat it! Start carving!
17387,"I think what they <hex:021A020203>mean<hex:021A020103> to say is, thank you, traveler. For everything."
17388,Do you remember when I said this was a bad idea?
17389,I'm going to need a bigger axe... And a sharper one... And maybe another one...
17390,What say next time we stick to nutkins?
17391,Ow... Has anyone seen my finger?
17392,How long's it been since we gave someone a proper beating? Two...three bells?
17393,No wonder I'm so bored! 
17394,"Stand still, now!<hex:02100103>Heh heh heh!"
17395,You weren't supposed to stab <hex:021A020203>back<hex:021A020103>!
17396,The boss is going to hear about this!
17397,Thought a round of fisticuffs'd leave me with a sense of fulfillment. Yet why do I feel so empty?
17398,"Not enough stabbing, I reckon. Might be we should do some more."
17399,Boss!
17400,You gotta help us!
17401,I don't got to do nothin'!
17402,<hex:021A020203>I'm<hex:021A020103> not the one who let himself get striped by this here streak of birdshite.
17403,But...I can't have your failings besmirch me sparkling reputation now. Let me show you lot how it's done.
17404,Yeah! Show us how it's done!
17405,"Kill 'em, boss!"
17406,B-Boss!?
17407,"Quick, or we'll be next...again!"
17408,"And that, my boys, is how one does a proper stabbin'."
17409,It was...<hex:021A020203>beautiful<hex:021A020103>.
17410,And stay down!
17411,This ends now!
17412,I brought some ointment!
17413,Requesting further support...
17414,Scanning for signs of the rogue unit...
17415,
17416,Let's deal with the ones in the way!
17417,"Quickly, into the freight elevator!"
17418,This is too cruel...
17419,"My pack is near bursting, but I suppose I could find room for a <hex:021A020203>few<hex:021A020103> more fronds..."
17420,This dill will save the lives of many. We are all in your debt!
17421,I have failed...
17422,"Now, to remove this core and─ Uh..."
17423,We...may have a problem...
17424,"Nothing <hex:021A020203>you<hex:021A020103> can't handle, though? Yes?"
17425,You sure you say you're not a hunter?
17426,'Cause I reckon they could use a bastard as mean as you.
17427,I'll see you around then? Thanks again for the help!
17428,...Forgive me!
17429,Thank you!
17430,Mrroooh!
17431,Hrrroohh!
17432,Mmmrrooh!?
17433,Hrruff!
17434,We must return to safety at once.
17435,Oh dear...
17436,"Wait! Slow down, <hex:02080EE905FF05>miss<hex:FF04>sir<hex:03>!"
17437,Not good...
17438,"Please, you have to do something!"
17439,I can't die here... Not like this!
17440,Allow me to learn from your example.
17441,"Ah, your positioning<hex:02100103>is spot on."
17442,"A moment, if you would..."
17443,Enemies!?
17444,"For this exercise, I cannot assist you..."
17445,No...I must hold out a little longer!
17446,We stand ready!
17447,Time to show off my brushstrokes!
17448,Right! Let's sweep this deck clean!
17449,It's an ambush!
17450,He lay in wait for us...
17451,Scheming bastard!
17452,That doesn't look good!
17453,He's broken the boat!
17454,"Damn you, Bakool Ja Ja!"
17455,'Tis the mother of all punutiy!
17456,Do they usually grow that large...?
17457,It's <hex:021A020203>huge<hex:021A020103>!
17458,Such monstrous lungs that creature had...
17459,I thought punutiy were meant to be timid...
17460,I'll never look at a punutiy the same way again!
17461,Some manner of mineshaft?
17462,This is the only path...
17463,"Whatever it is, the path leads onwards!"
17464,Such cheek!
17465,We'll have to find another route.
17466,They've copied our forms!
17467,Wait... That's us!
17468,What is going on!?
17469,This fellow seems quite at home...
17470,We can't simply sneak by...can we?
17471,We can't simply sneak by...can we?
17472,Not likely!
17473,So much for that...
17474,Out of the tunnels we go!
17475,Another victory for us!
17476,We've emerged somewhere upriver.
17477,It's so much brighter outside!
17478,Then let's press on!
17479,Some species of vilekin?
17480,Oh!<hex:02100103>Good gracious me!
17481,Gods below!<hex:02100103>What was <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>?
17482,Careful now.<hex:02100103>This fiend's a vicious one.
17483,It's the vilekin we saw earlier.
17484,My axe for a giant boot!
17485,The Skyruin falls today!<hex:02100103>For Tuliyollal!
17486,Stay alive.<hex:02100103>No foolish risks.
17487,The wind... It's all around us!
17488,Heh... This will be some fight.
17489,This is not a safe spot to stand...
17490,Hmph...<hex:02100103>A beast is a beast.
17491,Ware its breath!
17492,Ugh...<hex:02100103>I need to pay more attention!
17493,What's this now!?
17494,Its aether is staggering!
17495,"The sky, the ground...<hex:02100103>It's all changed!"
17496,Tricks to frighten children.
17497,"Once more, it distorts reality..."
17498,I... I...think I lost them...
17499,But they won't be far behind...
17500,Look! They've found us!
17501,A lifetime of gathering mushrooms...
17502,"Once again, my thanks!"
17503,The medicine made from these will benefit many.
17504,<sigh> I suppose this will have to do...
17505,Let us see how the herd is faring today.
17506,Whoa... Easy now. Easy.
17507,<agitated huffing>
17508,<frenzied lowing>
17509,Wait! Where are they going!?
17510,No... Lunyucaua'pyas!
17511,They'll devour the entire herd!
17512,"Please! The rroneek, they're all we have!"
17513,"Thanks to you, the herd is safe."
17514,Now to see if any wandered off...
17515,<sigh> The chief's going to have my head!
17516,"Let's go, everyone."
17517,It's remarkably cold down here...
17518,"Let's go, everyone."
17519,Stay on your guard. There's no telling what we might encounter.
17520,Look at all those roots...
17521,Those tree roots are enormous.
17522,0
17523,We really <hex:021A020203>are<hex:021A020103> beneath the forest...
17524,Doesn't seem keen on letting us through.
17525,A ray? In a place like this?
17526,Looks like a species of ray...
17527,"Whatever it is, we have to fight it."
17528,Coming through!
17529,That wasn't so bad.
17530,Didn't stand a chance!
17531,Everyone all right? Then let us proceed.
17532,This must be the quarry. We're on our way.
17533,So these are the Yok Huy quarries...
17534,We must have reached the Yok Huy quarries.
17535,Then we're on the right track.
17536,These sculptures couldn't be...
17537,Do you get the feeling we're being watched?
17538,Look at all of these statues...
17539,0
17540,Everyone stay alert. Something's amiss...
17541,I knew it. It's a trap!
17542,If only they'd stayed sleeping...
17543,"An impressive trap, I must say."
17544,I knew it. It's a trap!
17545,Good thing we're ready for them.
17546,That little one just hopped right in!
17547,0
17548,It can dream as big as it likes─we're still toppling it!
17549,All right! We did it!
17550,0
17551,Let's keep moving.
17552,That glowing stone...is it infused with aether?
17553,Now this is peculiar...
17554,0
17555,That stone is glowing with...aether?
17556,What <hex:021A020203>is<hex:021A020103> that?
17557,0
17558,That golden light...
17559,I-It's huge!
17560,A guardian this mighty must protect something precious.
17561,You've got to be joking.
17562,0
17563,"Time to test our mettle, then."
17564,Oh. Over already...
17565,It's the same as Zoraal Ja!
17566,"On your guard, everyone!"
17567,That was no resurrection magick...
17568,He looks more snake than man now.
17569,Wh-What is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
17570,A harrowing transformation.
17571,It's not unlike the chimeras of Allag.
17572,"Heh, you can't fool us!"
17573,An illusion!?
17574,Far too rough around the edges!
17575,It's easy if you know what to look for.
17576,What the─!?
17577,We deal with them too!
17578,"Oh, don't startle me like that!"
17579,Are they resources for souls!?
17580,Watch where you're standing!
17581,Ugh... My body...
17582,This is the power that destroyed the cages!?
17583,It affects living beings too!
17584,No backing down!
17585,The aetheric density has surged...
17586,Is he burning lives!?
17587,You'll have to do better than that!
17588,Time to strike back!
17589,The aetheric density has surged even further!
17590,Visions? What is he seeing?
17591,Is he hallucinating?
17592,"Alphinaud, get clear!"
17593,Understood!
17594,"Thick as thieves, these two..."
17595,Stop this! Your body won't survive!
17596,He won't stop! It falls to us to stop him!
17597,"Estinien, this way!"
17598,Right!
17599,A frightful transformation...
17600,This is the power you sought...?
17601,It's outside next!
17602,We can avoid it by closing the distance!
17603,What's happened!?
17604,He's manipulated the ambient aether!
17605,"Hmph, just a fancy trick."
17606,He's gathered blades outside!
17607,Does he mean to unleash them all at once?
17608,"Observe the aether, and you'll see where it's safe!"
17609,Keep calm and watch the flow of aether...
17610,Wh-What am I supposed to do!?
17611,He's created spatial distortions!
17612,Swords outside! Watch out!
17613,Their course changed!
17614,An irksome technique...
17615,"Argh, I've no idea what I'm looking at!"
17616,The flow of aether has become more distorted!
17617,No more looking! I'm going with feeling!
17618,"Everyone, gather to me!"
17619,Ugh!
17620,We must hold fast!
17621,Brace yourselves!
17622,You won't get the best of us!
17623,Does anyone else feel...itchy?
17624,I fear we've been cursed...
17625,We're onto your games now!
17626,You can <hex:021A020203>feel<hex:021A020103> the crackling in the air.
17627,The power of Valigarmanda...
17628,It's changing things again...
17629,Do your worst!<hex:02100103>We'll fight through it all!
17630,This biting cold...<hex:02100103>It's unbearable!
17631,We need to do something before we freeze to death!
17632,0
17633,0
17634,Be careful of the wind-infused ground!
17635,Damn it all!<hex:02100103>How could anyone see that coming!?
17636,Now it striketh from our flanks...
17637,I'm ready this time!
17638,Everything's gone back to normal!
17639,It must have tired of controlling the ambient aether.
17640,That's coming from the mountainside...<hex:02100103>Watch out behind us!
17641,Is the ground shaking?
17642,Whoa!
17643,We could have been buried alive...
17644,You won't catch me the same way twice.
17645,An icy embrace...<hex:02100103>We must needs keep in motion!
17646,So many urns...
17647,I'd rather not end up an icicle!
17648,To think of how much pain each vessel represents...
17649,Beneath the water...
17650,Hah! You missed me!
17651,<yawn>
17652,I will just have to return another day and hope the swarm has moved on by then.
17653,I shall protect thee.
17654,Keep your guard up!
17655,Curses...
17656,This isn't good.
17657,These magicks are too strong!
17658,My thanks.
17659,I thank you.
17660,Thank the Twelve...
17661,For Lamaty'i!
17662,He's beginning a ritual of flame!
17663,Wah!
17664,What!?
17665,Agh!
17666,Of course.
17667,Understood!
17668,He's a coward through and through!
17669,Over here!
17670,Hyaaah!
17671,Is the apex's power growing?
17672,Just give up!
17673,A salve to heal my wounds!
17674,Gyah!
17675,
17676,
17677,
17678,Nnngh...!?
17679,Wh-What!?
17680,Ugh...
17681,Alright. Let's go.
17682,"See, that wasn't so hard! And not a single courier was trampled!"
17683,"Well, my hold on the claim is up. I'll be heading back then."
17684,Thanks again for the scrap!
17685,<indignant bellowing>
17686,<disgruntled lowing>
17687,Not again!
17688,The stubborn bastard'll put the whole herd in danger!
17689,What am I supposed to do now?
17690,Give him what for... His hide is thick. He can take it.
17691,<murderous grunt>
17692,<annoyed snort>
17693,<submissive moan>
17694,<victorious bellow>
17695,What the hells happened here!?
17696,I saw the whole thing! The beast never stood a chance!
17697,I reckon he'll think twice before butting heads again.
17698,"I'll see his wounds are tended to. My thanks, adventurer."
17699,He's even more angry than before!
17700,
17701,"Stop them, now!"
17702,My precious potions...they're almost gone!
17703,"Give yourself up, Virazahn!"
17704,"We're almost there, darling. Just a little more."
17705,Pfffbt!
17706,"What is it, girl? What do you see?"
17707,Pfbt! Hmrf!
17708,Yeheheceyaa!? And today of all days!
17709,I reckon we should just turn back...
17710,Be careful now. Those things have a bite like a bear trap!
17711,Mrm!
17712,"That's right, girl! They're gone!"
17713,Seems this adventurer was true to their word.
17714,May happiness find you on your path!
17715,Mrm mrrrm.♪
17716,"Ah, well. Such is life."
17717,"Come on, darling. We'll try again on the morrow."
17718,Pfffbt!
17719,Chirp! Ribbit!
17720,Ribbit! Chiiirp! Croak!
17721,Chirp! Ribbit! Croooak!
17722,Croak! Ribbit! Chirp!
17723,Ribbit! Croooak! Chirp!
17724,Croak! Chirp! Ribiiit!
17725,Chirp! Croak! Ribbit!
17726,Squawk! See how I dance!
17727,Squaaawk! Craaaw!
17728,Craaaw! Squawk!
17729,Grrraaawk!
17730,Squaaawk! The dance never─squawk─stops!
17731,Squawk! You dance! I dance! Squaaawk!
17732,What shall I─squawk─sing for you next!?
17733,"Dance, dance, dance! Squaaawk!"
17734,Chirp! Croak! Chiiirp!
17735,We're in your hands.
17736,You'll have to finish this without me!
17737,"First sentries, now this...?"
17738,There are just too many...
17739,I'm afraid all the good dill is further in the swarm...
17740,They told me these things were inoperable!
17741,Happy hunting!
17742,The army needs to clean up their own damn mess.
17743,If they'd only move...!
17744,Woolbacks? Woolbacks? Why is it always woolbacks!?
17745,"Bolt hounds, eh? This should be interesting..."
17746,Be sure to keep an eye out for those pups.
17747,The creatures of the land have forgotten who they are.
17748,I have seen such a thing but once before...
17749,...when last the Serpentlord Ttokrrone walked this land.
17750,Let us show him we fear not his minions!
17751,"The day is ours, but the foul hands we stayed were just that─hands."
17752,"To kill a snake, one must cut off its head."
17753,"And to do that, one must first lure the snake from its den."
17754,"We will meet again, traveler. I am certain of it."
17755,0
17756,Today we have failed...
17757,"But like the almighty sun, with each dawn shall opportunity rise anew."
17758,All right!
17759,I know somebody's out there. I can smell 'em!
17760,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
17761,Hah hah hah!
17762,Right in the gut!
17763,Would you look at this one!
17764,This is gonna be fun...
17765,"Those tears, I see? You want me to stop? Do you?"
17766,"Yeah, do you!?"
17767,What just happened...?
17768,That...hurt?
17769,This was supposed to be easy!
17770,Ugh...
17771,Alright! Alright!
17772,You're lucky the boss weren't here!
17773,Hit 'em harder!
17774,Hit 'em faster!
17775,"You got 'em, boss!"
17776,Just a little more!
17777,"Alright! Alright! No need to rub it in, now..."
17778,Chirp!
17779,Ribbit!
17780,Croak!
17781,I swore to defend this tower with my life... And now...
17782,Someone...help... Please!
17783,Fall back!
17784,Is the cargo safe?
17785,"Without that sweetener, this cycle's crops could fail, and my people starve!"
17786,Are they...all gone?
17787,"We did it! Er... <hex:021A020203>You<hex:021A020103> did it. And the cargo's safe! Well, most of it, at least."
17788,No! That was the last crate!
17789,"I'm sorry, brothers...<hex:02100103>I have failed you..."
17790,...now I'm the one about to be plucked!
17791,"Oh, and try not to breathe in any of the spores!"
17792,"Remember, only the ik'iit ears. The fly agarics are pure poison!"
17793,Ribbit! Ribbiiit! Chirp!
17794,"You can do it, kupo!"
17795,"O-Oh, dear!"
17796,"Excellent work, kupo!"
17797,"Beruru... Answer me, Beruru!"
17798,Taste the fury of the mountains!
17799,
17800,What potent magic. In that case...
17801,Keep heart!
17802,I shall protect thee.
17803,I have your back!
17804,This should help!
17805,
17806,"No mercy, eh?"
17807,"I-I'm fine, I'm fine!"
17808,Such power...
17809,Alisaie! Are you all right!?
17810,Father's magicks are incredible...
17811,Beware your surroundings!
17812,Mark the trajectory of his blades.
17813,Grrr...
17814,"Squawk! Fun, fun, fun! Craaaw!"
17815,Chirp!
17816,Ribbit!
17817,Croak!
17818,Time to make them pay!
17819,"Let's get inside, quickly!"
17820,"Finally, time to go on the offensive!"
17821,The way is open. We should hurry.
17822,"Right, let's give them a sound thrashing!"
17823,"Well, that didn't take long."
17824,Bring it on!
17825,Is everyone ready?
17826,Zoraal Ja holds command over all of this?
17827,"A red vehicle. An indication of rank, perhaps?"
17828,What have we here?
17829,No doubt it's as swift as the others. Have care.
17830,"Well, they have good taste in colors, I'll give them that."
17831,Let's keep moving.
17832,They'll have to try harder than that.
17833,"So far, so good."
17834,Here they come!
17835,Watch out!
17836,Is there no end to their defenses?
17837,This place just keeps getting stranger and stranger.
17838,Everything appears to be made of the same strange substance.
17839,"The sooner we can leave this place, the better."
17840,"Nowhere to go but forward, it seems..."
17841,Hmph. Another hunk of metal for the scrap pile.
17842,"Well, well. What have we here?"
17843,I was only joking when I said they need to try harder.
17844,"This one is rather imposing, isn't it?"
17845,"Hah, that was too easy!"
17846,"How much further, I wonder?"
17847,Glad that's over with.
17848,How was Zoraal Ja able to conceive of such weaponry?
17849,Let's deal with this quickly and get going!
17850,We'll not be so easily discouraged.
17851,Did they really think this would deter us?
17852,The walls hum with energy!
17853,Is this the best they can do?
17854,They're growing desperate.
17855,As if this would stop us.
17856,We must be getting close to an exit.
17857,"If it is, we'll be through in no time at all."
17858,<hex:021A020203>This<hex:021A020103> is their leader?
17859,Something's not right about this.
17860,So they're all that stands between us and the way out?
17861,This one appears to be human.
17862,An ill wind blows...stirring hearts to madness.
17863,"It is all I can do to keep the evil at bay. The creatures of the land, I fear, shall not fare as well."
17864,The Serpentlord's return is closer than I believed.
17865,We must release the poor creatures from evil's embrace!
17866,"The day is ours, yes..."
17867,...but this victory is far from the end.
17868,The alligators will not be the last of the Serpentlord's victims...
17869,...unless we can end the Serpentlord himself.
17870,"I shall contemplate, and return once I have been shown the path."
17871,0
17872,0
17873,Curse these old bones...
17874,Perhaps the Landsguard will fare better...
17875,"The land here bears many wounds, and its blood rises to the surface to harden like a scab..."
17876,...as the elementals gather to dance in its everlasting glow.
17877,It is with that blood that I shall exact my revenge.
17878,Much of the land's blood will be needed to summon the Serpentlord.
17879,"Yes, I do believe this will suffice. You have done my people a great service today, traveler."
17880,"And once again, I have failed..."
17881,"But I am not beaten. I will be back tomorrow, and the next day. For the next hundred days, if that is what it takes!"
17882,"Travelers! I call upon you to aid me in my search for the Blood of the Land, and together we might vanquish the Serpentlord once and for all!"
17883,We won't forget these children. Not ever.
17884,You're quick on your feet!
17885,These spikes are rather ominous...
17886,Then we break them.<hex:02100103>This one first!
17887,To me!<hex:02100103>Brace for the worst!
17888,Ugh!
17889,"Endure, my friends!"
17890,It's n-not so bad...
17891,We can take this!
17892,A momentary discomfort...
17893,Haaah!<hex:02100103>You won't break us!
17894,Of course!
17895,This is not at all like the Garleans or the Allagans.
17896,Are we still in their encampment?
17897,Who could have built all this?
17898,Is everyone still with us!?
17899,I daresay we've not seen its like before.
17900,Namikka...
17901,
17902,Then let's finish this!
17903,"Endless strength or not, victory will be ours!"
17904,"Is that the Skyruin's true strength, then?"
17905,Again with the ambient aether...?<hex:02100103>Its energies are inexhaustible!
17906,We're barely halfway.<hex:02100103>The real climb starts from here!
17907,Now the climb gets difficult...
17908,We've been climbing for ages...
17909,And we're barely halfway.<hex:02100103>The real climb starts from here!
17910,Look at all these crystals...
17911,The ambient aether is dense enough to form crystals...
17912,Evidence of how dense this ambient aether must be.
17913,What...is that?
17914,An arcane entity of some kind?
17915,Must be a snow spirit!<hex:02100103>Not that I've ever seen one.
17916,I feel chilled to the bone...
17917,Phew.<hex:02100103>It was tougher than it looked.
17918,There better not be any more of those.
17919,I know those scales...
17920,Isn't that...?
17921,Zoraal Ja!
17922,Gods!
17923,Goodness!
17924,Dammit!
17925,Hey! You come back here!
17926,"Well, that's inconvenient..."
17927,This won't stop us!
17928,"Sorry to trespass, but this is the only way through!"
17929,It doesn't look pleased to see us up here...
17930,That's the bird that attacked the giants!
17931,"Yes, and it doesn't look pleased to see us..."
17932,"Right, back to the climb!"
17933,We did it!
17934,We did it!
17935,Heh...<hex:02100103>That was barely a challenge!
17936,Better watch your step─that's a long drop!
17937,We're above the clouds now...
17938,Great sunken gods!<hex:02100103>We're so high up!
17939,"Better watch your step, then!"
17940,"If it's a fight he wants, then let's give it to him!"
17941,"Goodness, he must be twice the size of the other Yok Huy!"
17942,So that's the High Luminary...<hex:02100103>He... He's huge!
17943,"We'll clear the way, don't you worry!"
17944,Understood!
17945,"Right, let's do this!"
17946,Just leave the fighting to us!
17947,You mean these are all...?
17948,A chilling sight...
17949,How did it come to this...?
17950,The sight alone is hard to bear...
17951,It's heartbreaking just to look at...
17952,No holding back!
17953,What a bizarre creature...
17954,"Come on, then!"
17955,Let's take care of it!
17956,"The asps of Shaaloani are a greedy lot, forever feeding off the land's lifeblood."
17957,They will be drawn to the crystal we have gathered like flies to a corpse.
17958,When they emerge is when we strike. Slay the Serpentlord's spawn that he may know the anguish felt by his victims.
17959,Vile lord of serpents! Look upon the land and see it drown in the lifeblood of your kin!
17960,Do not allow the asps to retreat to the sands with the crystal!
17961,"The asps' cries have died, and land long dry has been churned to mud."
17962,The Serpentlord will not allow this affront to go unpunished. He will seek revenge.
17963,"And we will be ready. But first, we must wait."
17964,0
17965,0
17966,The Serpentlord need not rise while his children writhe.
17967,"And writhe they do, their bellies full on the Blood of the Land."
17968,"But I shall not relent. As long as the Serpentlord draws breath, I will find a way to end him!"
17969,"Oh, to get just a glimpse of her!"
17970,The princess's airship is coming to Victors' March!
17971,And that's that!
17972,Now we can continue on.
17973,Good work. Let's keep moving!
17974,Nothing to it.
17975,Let's keep moving!
17976,Do you need a hand?
17977,You're not alone!
17978,"We have done all that we can─silenced his heralds, sacrificed his children. The trap is laid. The tural vidraal stirs."
17979,"Rise, O lord of the serpents! He who dwells beneath the shifting sands and would swallow all creation. Feel the blood of your kin wet on your scales and rage!"
17980,Know the sorrow you have sown and rise to reap your revenge! We await your return with bated breath...and blades drawn.
17981,The Serpentlord is slain!
17982,O fallen kin! May you now and forever rest in peace.
17983,"And you, my friends! Tales of the day's deeds will be sung by my people till the sun no longer rises and the moon no longer weeps. You will <hex:021A020203>not<hex:021A020103> be forgotten."
17984,0
17985,Nothing is going to stop us!
17986,It seems the security level has increased.
17987,We came ready for this!
17988,The only way is forward...
17989,This is so wrong...
17990,It's at once beautiful and sad...
17991,Souls truly are just a resource here...
17992,It's heartening to have support.
17993,You do not want to become lost here.
17994,Right!
17995,I don't like the feel of this... Let's proceed with care.
17996,Are those giant hands?
17997,Some kind of machine!?
17998,Doesn't look like it'll let us through.
17999,That is no ordinary mechanical soldier!
18000,Just one last push to the top!
18001,Onwards to the upper level!
18002,Victory is ours!
18003,"Whew, we did it..."
18004,Let's go!
18005,"Right, in we go!"
18006,Everyone ready?
18007,So this will take us above...
18008,Of course!
18009,Let's keep moving!
18010,"What will we find here, I wonder."
18011,The air somehow feels colder here...
18012,We have to stop them from being misused.
18013,Being stored...like common goods.
18014,These are all lives...
18015,It's chilling to see souls treated with such indifference.
18016,That's what the hunters use...
18017,The aberrance is reminiscent of the Allagan Empire.
18018,Feral souls... I can't get used to the idea...
18019,A facility for researching souls...
18020,How could you twist a living creature like that?
18021,Mechanical augmentation... This wouldn't have been amiss in Allag.
18022,A giant enemy tortoise!?
18023,It appears to be enhanced with electrope!
18024,"I don't know why, but I suddenly feel a chill..."
18025,This is no mechanical soldier...
18026,Something feels seriously off about this one...
18027,Oh gods... His aura...it's so very wrong...
18028,"Focus, Krile! It's time to fight!"
18029,A shame this elevator doesn't go straight to the top.
18030,Let us stay on our guard.
18031,"So far, so good..."
18032,He controls the blades!
18033,"We can evade it, surely!"
18034,If it executes the process...
18035,Here it comes again!
18036,"Gah, my head can't keep up!"
18037,It's split into pieces!
18038,It's definitely up to something!
18039,Beware the spheres yonder!
18040,It changes tactics by rearranging itself!
18041,The sword's changed sides!
18042,It controls it with lightning!
18043,Have care on the weapon side!
18044,The piece on its back has separated!
18045,It's controlling its parts remotely!
18046,"Want to get us from all directions, eh?"
18047,It's harnessing power!
18048,"Through those contraptions, it seems."
18049,Then we better destroy them!
18050,It's harnessing even more power!
18051,Here comes the big one!
18052,"Quickly, stand together!"
18053,We're inside Sphene's memories...
18054,Is this Alexandria as it was when she lived?
18055,A virtual domain generated by her memories...
18056,The people really did love her.
18057,Even the citizens have been recreated.
18058,She truly was the people's princess...
18059,She was goodness personified.
18060,We'll remove them instead!
18061,Naturally.
18062,It appears we've been discovered.
18063,Even back then she was close to her people...
18064,All is right in the world...
18065,To think that she is right there...
18066,"Whatever this is, it's going down!"
18067,The system is intervening directly in the memories...
18068,Let's clear the path!
18069,How do you like that!?
18070,We did it!
18071,There will be more interference. Let us remain vigilant.
18072,Huh? Is this is still Alexandria?
18073,What in the world has happened...?
18074,I daresay we are come to a different time.
18075,Everything is in ruins...
18076,"I know this is only a memory, but still..."
18077,This is the culmination of the Storm Surge...
18078,"This feels so real, it hurts not to help them..."
18079,This is only a memory... It's all in the past now...
18080,I can't help but remember the future I lived...
18081,I know... I need to remind myself it's only a memory...
18082,The airships are in trouble!
18083,Twelve have mercy...
18084,That airship is shielding the other!
18085,Out of our way!
18086,"Whatever bars our way, we'll brush aside!"
18087,It matters not what bars our way!
18088,We'll brush them all aside!
18089,And that's that!
18090,<pant> Need a moment to catch my breath...
18091,Another obstacle out of the way.
18092,Are we in a different time again?
18093,It appears to be the same place...
18094,The war appears to have ended...
18095,Huh? Something seems off...
18096,The memory banks have become unstable.
18097,Are the memories breaking down?
18098,What's going on!?
18099,I have a bad feeling about this... Let's hurry!
18100,The system itself may have become unstable.
18101,"It's not because of us, is it?"
18102,"We're coming, Sphene!"
18103,The final obstacle...
18104,Let's keep a close eye on that sword and fist.
18105,We'll find her as soon as we've dealt with this!
18106,What happened here...?
18107,These creatures were killed...
18108,Some territorial dispute?
18109,Let's proceed with care!
18110,It's employing countermeasures against Cahciua's program!
18111,So this is where gladiators once learned their craft...
18112,This chill in the air... 'Tis a far cry from the desert heat.
18113,What manner of creature lurks in these depths?
18114,The stench of beasts... We must needs remain cautious.
18115,This flow of aether looks promising enough. Let's dive in!
18116,This confluence should bear us onward.
18117,What happens if we pull this?
18118,Perhaps we ought to loosen that winch.
18119,The aether beckons. Let us make haste.
18120,Let us ride the aetherial flow.
18121,Heh! Even that brawn's no match for me!
18122,A demon of the ninth rung? Curious...
18123,An ogre...and a formidable one at that.
18124,Fell being of darkness begone!
18125,
18126,
18127,
18128,
18129,I won't lose...!
18130,I'll protect everyone!
18131,"There are beasts here, too!?"
18132,That one looks mean. Be careful!
18133,I have a bad feeling about this...
18134,You did it!
18135,Grrr...!
18136,Graaagh!
18137,Ah! What are those!?
18138,Rrraaargh!
18139,Urrrgh!
18140,What happened here?
18141,Aaah!
18142,Groaaar!
18143,Ugh...
18144,Unnngh...
18145,Grrruuugh!
18146,Ahhhg...
18147,Grah!
18148,What was Father doing here?
18149,Has that thing been sealed away all this time!?
18150,0
18151,It would be fortunate if they ran this way...
18152,We must pray the hhetso are all right.
18153,They may be too frightened to find us...
18154,What if the tturuhhetso got to them!?
18155,I think I see...
18156,Yes!
18157,No teeth marks...
18158,Thank goodness.
18159,This one is unhurt.
18160,Who's a good rroneek?
18161,All is well...
18162,<grunt>
18163,<snuffle>
18164,Run!
18165,Call the hunters!
18166,There!
18167,0
18168,Seriously!?
18169,Aid the hhetso!
18170,That rroneek is hurt!
18171,Oof!
18172,Oh dear...
18173,Where did they all come from!?
18174,How do you like that!? ...Ahem.
18175,<bellow>
18176,<grunt>
18177,Gah! For the love of...
18178,0
18179,The legs!
18180,Hraaah!
18181,0
18182,Get close!
18183,Ha!
18184,0
18185,0
18186,0
18187,Cleave!
18188,Reap!
18189,In stillness freeze!
18190,Sink into silence!
18191,...Didn't think she'd be so quick to trade blows.
18192,"Gehehe, well fought!"
18193,Never seen ruins like these before...
18194,This way!
18195,That's no ordinary construct.
18196,"What does that do, I wonder?"
18197,"Ah, I see!"
18198,An exit? Or...
18199,Another transporter. But to where?
18200,
18201,To hell with you!
18202,Wretched filth!
18203,This is the end!
18204,There is no escape!
18205,Begone!
18206,
18207,
18208,
18209,
18210,
18211,
18212,Wait for it...
18213,BAM!!!
18214,Auroral Uppercut!
18215,By the light of the dawn!
18216,Nullifying Dropkick!
18217,You can't stop the flood of mortal existence!
18218,Open your eyes!
18219,Now to send you packing!
18220,What!?
18221,We will win this!
18222,Let's bring them down!
18223,Our victory depends on you!
18224,Where is it hiding?
18225,Come out!
18226,That's the creature Apyaahi was riding!
18227,They attack from above!
18228,0
18229,0
18230,0
18231,Ahhh!
18232,"Impressive, Kuiyki!"
18233,You saved my hide!
18234,Raaahhh!
18235,<huff> <puff>
18236,Are you alright!?
18237,Oh my!
18238,W-Wait!
18239,0
18240,Thank you for keeping us safe! We've almost got her!
18241,Eyes peeled for anything brown and fluffy!
18242,You're all right...
18243,There's someone coming!
18244,Nice!
18245,It has yet to recollect its aether.
18246,"There's no telling where this leads, but it's better than staying here."
18247,"Let's be off, then."
18248,Aquarius should be here...
18249,"We aren't too late, are we?"
18250,What is that? Some kind of tural vidraal?
18251,"Are we lost again? Wait, look there!"
18252,Aquarius!
18253,"Oh gods, and it has company!"
18254,Looks like it's their problem now. Let's go.
18255,A dragon! But surely it's no match for you.
18256,There's something about that big tower...
18257,Let's go and have a look.
18258,
18259,What? Why only you!?
18260,<grunt>
18261,<rumble>
18262,<bellow>
18263,They're...they're moving!
18264,More of them!
18265,
18266,They're all...
18267,0
18268,"Right then, let's begin!"
18269,I hope you're warmed up...
18270,What do you make of <hex:021A020203>this<hex:021A020103>?
18271,Keep your wits about you...
18272,One last push until the end!
18273,Excellent!
18274,Nice work.
18275,Ha! That went well.
18276,Perfect!
18277,"You'll get it next time, eh?"
18278,Just keep calm and focus.
18279,Don't lose heart!
18280,"Practice makes perfect, as they say."
18281,"Well done, everyone!"
18282,"That was kind of fun, actually."
18283,"A worthwhile exercise, if you ask me!"
18284,Phew... Over at last...
18285,Argh!
18286,That hurt...
18287,Urgh!
18288,Ouch...
18289,Spread out!
18290,Group up!
18291,Direct it away from us!
18292,Look out!
18293,Take it away from the group!
18294,"Spread out, but mind your step!"
18295,Over here!
18296,Let's split into two groups!
18297,I've got it! Let's all run clockwise!
18298,Everyone gather at the point of impact!
18299,Try to stand right at the edge...
18300,Look out!
18301,Let's each take command of a tower!
18302,I've got this one!
18303,"Position yourself carefully, now..."
18304,"Once you've recovered, get to a tower, quick!"
18305,We'll need to dodge both of these...
18306,"Take a tower, but watch your step!"
18307,"Everyone, retreat to safety!"
18308,Grab that tether!
18309,"Quickly, avert your eyes!"
18310,Allow me to cleanse you!
18311,I need Esuna...

18313,_rsv_18313_-1_1_0_0_SCFE39641_ECFE39641
18314,"Watch your step, but keep your back turned!"
18315,Keep your distance while you dodge these attacks!
18316,Let's each handle one bomb apiece!
18317,"Worry not, I can cure you!"
18318,Stay calm and cast Esuna on each of us!
18319,0
18320,This is our best chance...
18321,
18322,
18323,
18324,
18325,
18326,
18327,Ngh!
18328,"Flawless tactics, everyone!"
18329,
18330,
18331,Koana!
18332,Will do!
18333,The protective aether is there...
18334,Conducted by the scales...
18335,"Now, trace that back..."
18336,To the point of greatest density!
18337,The land trembles before my might!
18338,
18339,<duuun>
18340,Caw! Caw!
18341,<sniff> <sniff>
18342,Grawrrr!
18343,Welcome to Kozama'uka!
18344,<whoosh>
18345,
18346,Darkness take you all!
18347,I think not!
18348,Choo-choo!
18349,"You're a lifesaver, Ceetol Ja!"
18350,
18351,
18352,Leave this to me!
18353,What an attack!
18354, <pant> <pant>
18355,<wheeze> <pant>
18356,Tentoawa needs help!
18357,
18358,"It's over, Apyaahi!"
18359,Together we will triumph!
18360,Is the treasure making it stronger?
18361,We are here!
18362,"Let's finish this together, <hex:022C0DFF07><hex:022903EB0203><hex:FF02> <hex:0203>!"
18363,This thing won't go down easily...
18364,Now!
18365,You shall be consumed by the cowardice that binds you...
18366,Cowardice dismembers!
18367,You shall be twisted by the envy that drives you...
18368,Envy engulfs!
18369,You shall be burned by the rage that controls you...
18370,Rage cleaves!
18371,You shall be defeated by the apathy that plagues you...
18372,Apathy strikes!
18373,You shall be smothered by the arrogance that consumes you...
18374,Arrogance defiles!
18375,The one on the left is all yours!
18376,Hm...?
18377,What in the...?
18378,
18379,What's it doing!?
18380,Is it...consuming the aether?
18381,What do we do?
18382,It's infusing the rocks with aether!
18383,It's pierced the pillar with its tusks!
18384,We've seen that trick before!
18385,It's fond of that tactic.
18386,Again!?
18387,We have to dodge!
18388,We won't fall prey to the same attack!
18389,It's trying something different!
18390,Look! The ground!
18391,What's it up to now?
18392,Careful!
18393,Is it gathering power?
18394,What now!?
18395,This bodes ill...
18396,Are these...souls?
18397,So many...
18398,They're gathering...
18399,Enough of that!
18400,Even worse than before...
18401,There's that chill again...
18402,More of them?
18403,Here they come...
18404,I...I can't move!
18405,Keep your wits about you.
18406,What's he got up his sleeve this time?
18407,Ungh... My head is spinning...
18408,Stay calm and keep your distance!
18409,That doesn't look good!
18410,It's up to something... On your guard!
18411,I think we've made it angry.
18412,Spread out!
18413,This next attack will be fierce. Stay alert!
18414,I can't even see the bottom!
18415,It opened a hole in the ground!
18416,"Fall, and I won't be able to save you!"
18417,Watch your step!
18418,How deep does this hole go?
18419,Such strength!
18420,Something moves beneath us!
18421,Careful!
18422,I'm getting tired of this...
18423,How is it still standing!?
18424,Patience will lead us to victory!
18425,Not a moment's peace...
18426,They're like giant earthworms!
18427,What disgusting creatures!
18428,They almost look alive.
18429,Keep your distance!
18430,And stay down!
18431,
18432,

18443,
18444,
18445,
18446,
18447,The lightning hasn't let up here either.
18448,To think we'd find a place like this so far from Everkeep.
18449,Even the creatures here are electrified...
18450,"Watch out, Tepeke!"
18451,The lightning rods are still operational...
18452,Oh my!
18453,Bolts can strike anywhere─step lightly!
18454,
18455,I guess we've stepped into its territory.
18456,I'm ready for you!
18457,Quite the mouthful of fangs. Don't get too close!
18458,We've no choice but to press on!
18459,An easy win!
18460,Let us proceed.
18461,"Well, it all worked out."
18462,"You are a credit to your title, Vow of Resolve."
18463,In we go!
18464,"Quite imposing, isn't it?"
18465,A remote facility with a secret purpose...
18466,Hardly any signs there was ever a village here...
18467,"These are people, right...?"
18468,They were experimenting on their own...?
18469,How dreadful...
18470,Is this the man in charge?
18471,There's something unsettling about the aether here.
18472,We won't be passing through without a fight.
18473,What happened to them?
18474,The seal? The beast? What was he talking about?
18475,Let us delve further.
18476,Let us pray these souls are now at peace.
18477,It keeps going. So should we.
18478,By the gods... What is <hex:021A020203>that<hex:021A020103>!?
18479,I can hardly believe my eyes...
18480,Let's get a closer look!
18481,Ah... I think I know what awaits us.
18482,Is there any way to stop it?
18483,We may soon face our fiercest foe yet.
18484,All the more reason to deal with it here and now!
18485,A tural vidraal...no doubt about it.
18486,We must slay it before it breaks free!
18487,Its strength of will is overwhelming...
18488,The wrath of the heavens is frightening indeed.
18489,Really? Again!?
18490,Not exactly a leisurely trek...
18491,
18492,
18493,
