1,"You find the smoldering remains of magitek armor, no doubt left after a fierce battle."
2,"You find a pile of well-worn blades and shields, though not of imperial design."
3,"You pick up the research documents and find page after page of meticulous calculations and observational data on Dalamud. Young Cid posits that the lesser moon may very well possess the ability to harness and manipulate solar power.<hex:02100103>Moreover, the vast stores of energy it has amassed over the millennia, should they be unleashed, would far exceed any parameters the transmission tower may have been designed to withstand."
4,This magitek reaper's fighting days are over.
5,"Due to your rough treatment, the magitek reaper has gone from merely immobile to entirely inoperational."

10,"You have inserted the identification key, but the magitek reaper cannot be activated without fuel."

18,"The unfortunate soldier was carrying a medical kit.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>In this battle, you are unable to use the full extent of your powers. To reach Camp Broken Glass quickly, you should avoid combat whenever possible.<hex:02100103>If you are discovered, your foes will give chase. The magitek units are especially powerful, and your chances of defeating them in your current state are slim at best.<hex:02100103>You may use medical kits to restore depleted HP. While you can only carry a limited number, more can be found by inspecting fallen soldiers or wrecked magitek."

28,"You have refueled the magitek reaper, but it cannot be activated without the identification key, which may still be in the possession of the pilot.<hex:02100103>Search the area for the pilot."
29,"Flurries of tiny bubbles break the water's surface at regular intervals. Some manner of creature hiding under the lily pad, perhaps."
30,"An impression on the edge of the lily pad suggests someone knelt here, perhaps to draw water."
31,Resting at the bottom of the pool is an animal carcass overgrown with plant life. Perhaps it fell in while foraging for food.
32,"Fine scorch marks are in evidence on the leafage, reminiscent of those left by sage magicks."
33,"A message is engraved in the common tongue...<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>In the beginning, the Lord of the Inferno shared with us His flame.<hex:02100103>Speak the name of the gift He bestowed upon our bloodline."

35,"You find ravaged beast remains, torn to shreds by sharp talons..."
36,You find feathers are scattered about the ground. There are signs of a fierce struggle...
37,The cloying stench of fresh leavings assails your nostrils. Whatever beast left them is likely still close by...
38,Row upon row of names are shown on the terminal display. It appears to be a list of those who were recently “taken to the cloud.”<hex:02100103>Might Namikka be among them...?
39,"All instructions in the processing manual must be strictly observed. As we have charge of the realm's most vital resource, actions resulting in damage or loss constitute a serious crime.<hex:02100103><hex:02100103>First Stage: Extraction<hex:02100103>Mixed aether comprised of both memory and soul is extracted from regulators and transferred into the stabilizing tank. As hastening extraction increases the risk of damage, the rate must not be adjusted except in the event of an emergency."
40,Priority Observation Subject<hex:02100103>Identification number: 161127<hex:02100103>Name: Namikka<hex:02100103>Physical cessation age: 86<hex:02100103>Citizen memory erasure: Completed<hex:02100103>Corporeal disposal: Completed<hex:02100103>Aether extraction: Completed
41,"Second Stage: Separation<hex:02100103>Mixed aether is put through the aetheric separator and divided into its soul and memory components. Soul aether is then conveyed to upper Origenics for final processing, and memory aether to the Meso Terminal (route and location classified).<hex:02100103>Unless expressly specified, the memories of fiends are discarded."
42,"Third Stage: Purification<hex:02100103>Separated souls undergo thorough cleansing for the removal of residual memories. The purifying light is harmful to organic beings, so utmost care must be taken during the procedure.<hex:02100103>Even the slightest contamination may lead to memory and personality disorders within the user. As such, each and every soul must be cleared using the precision detector.<hex:02100103>Having completed the aforementioned processes, a soul may finally be made available to the people of Alexandria. Your efforts are essential for the functioning of our nation, and we thank you for undertaking your duties with diligence."
43,"Experiment log 216. Subject: Ambrose<hex:02100103>Experiment sees a soulless body infused with multiple souls, including those of beasts, via a prototype multi-regulator.<hex:02100103>Subject currently behaves within the parameters of a living person, but displays advanced symptoms of personality breakdown and destructive tendencies. This is all but certainly due to an overdominance of feral souls. Yet while the subject possesses phenomenal strength, it cannot be reliably controlled, rendering it unfit for purpose. Future experiments must focus on imposing loyalty and obedience."
