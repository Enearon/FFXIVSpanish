,Typhon's signature technique produces gale-force winds by propelling concentrated air through the nostrils─though mages recreate the gust externally, for the sake of nasal integrity. In addition to buffeting foes backward, it appears to have a detrimental effect on its target's mental state.

,Employed to great effect by Ultros, this technique crushes adversaries beneath a phantom weight. Due to reticence in the scholastic community regarding certain forms of testing, whether the weight applied feels like that of four full tonzes is a question that remains unanswered.

,This spell, easily mastered via defeat of a kraken, fires a concentrated burst of water at one's opponent. As the liquid itself is conjured by manipulating aether to condense moisture in the air, the technique remains effective regardless of whether or not its caster has access to a body of water.

,Favored by sirens, the Song of Torment carries in its melody a malicious enchantment. It ensnares the listener's spirit, inducing phantom pain that soon becomes physical as the body struggles to process the mind's trauma.

,An industrial form of machina-based aetherial manipulation developed and adapted by the Allagan Empire. Through the compression of ambient lightning-aspected aether, the caster (or casting machina) floods the vicinity with highly charged arcs of electricity.

,This spell manipulates wind- and earth-aspected aether to call forth the umbral, imbuing exhaled air with miasma. Attempts to replicate the morbol's Bad Breath sans its inherent horrific stench have been unsuccessful, thus it retains its title as the <Emphasis>foulest</Emphasis> of blue magicks.

,Replicating this technique requires magically altering one's own state of mind to mimic that of a zu. The flying strike that results surpasses normal physical limitations, but requires dispensing with caution in favor of an all-consuming rage─the sensible mage will shield herself with aether first.

,Just like that all-too-well-known fixture in the arsenals of many earthy soulkin, this technique creates a localized quake around the caster. According to legend, the earth itself will appear to shatter under a true master of the spell.

,This technique pelts foes with seedlike aetherial orbs, which then explode to release the soporific within. Scholars believe that similar defense mechanisms were originally developed by treants and other species vulnerable to vilekin in order to prevent their boring of holes and leeching of sap.

,Primarily used by soulflayers, though reportedly also found in Blaster's arsenal, Mind Blast assaults nearby foes' perceptions, tormenting them with the sensation of manifold cuts. Senses overwhelmed, victims' bodies react as if perception were reality, leaving them wounded and paralyzed.

,Through the draining of blood, this spell saps a foe's aether, a portion of which is then absorbed by the caster. In nature, such habits first appeared in creatures such as bats and chigoes, who naturalists theorize developed the ability to absorb nutrients via blood over the course of centuries.

,This spell creates an aetherial replica of the sort of bomb preferred by goblins. Of course, goblin bombs acquire their combustive force through the use of magically enhanced gunpowder, so mimicking this effect with aether alone requires no small amount of effort, but the results are...explosive.

,Highly famed─and feared─due to its frequent use by cactuars, 1000 Needles showers one's surroundings with a hail of slim projectiles. Despite their magical nature, the velocity at which the blue mage's pseudo-spines are propelled ensures that they are quite as painful as the real thing.

,This technique mimics the Drill Cannons of machina by winding aetherial currents until they resemble rapidly spinning projectiles. Like the physical drills upon which they are patterned, these projectiles excel at penetrating stone.

,Common amongst dahaks, this technique requires using the position of one's own eyes to anchor arcane geometries in which to concentrate aether. The user then expels the aether, propelled by ill will, in the direction of his gaze─though this tends to earn him a fair bit of ire in return.

,At this point, tonberries' predilection for sharpened knives is well known. By manipulating aether to harness feelings of resentment, one hones a keener blade for driving into the heart of the enemy. Naturally, being beset by this attack while unable to move is a uniquely harrowing experience.

,To utilize this simple teleportation spell, casters must create an aetherial current upon which to travel between their location and the desired position. Though this is only effective over short distances, it is nevertheless an invaluable tool in the event that one needs to beat a hasty retreat.

,As with thaumaturgical fire spells, the jet of flame produced by this technique manifests from a burst of fire-aspected aether. Certain weapons produce similar effects; however, this is not through aetherial manipulation, but rather the copious use of highly flammable liquid.

,Originally developed as a means of defense from flesh-eating beasts, this favorite of the Qiqirn tribes produces a shockwave as its user strikes together palms filled with concentrated aether, leaving foes witless.

,Perhaps best known as the unsettling hallmark of the cyclops, Glower involves funneling aether through the eyes as if they were arcane circles─much like its sister spell, The Look. Its highly concentrated aether strikes foes like a levinbolt, leaving their skin singed and muscles seizing.

,A magical imitation of warmachina technology, this technique allows the user to fire a barrage of aetherial missiles. When efficacious─which, bear in mind, is not guaranteed─it sends a shock through the foe that appears to resonate more the greater their vitality.

,White Wind imbues a localized current of air with purified aether, distributing its curative effects throughout the vicinity. Though powerful for such a simple spell, the purification of sufficient aether requires significant magical exertion on the part of the caster, and thus should be used sparingly.

,A desperate mage's last resort, this technique converts all of the user's life force to an aetherial poison that is then injected into a single adversary. Suffice it to say that, as with the physical sting of the wespe, it should not be relied upon in but the most dire of circumstances.

,Credited as the source of the “bomb” voidsent family's name, Self-destruct, when used by blue mages, converts the entirety of its caster's energy into fire-aspected aether to cause an explosion. The application of oil has been observed to make it more effective─though likely also more painful.

,In nature, Sticky Tongue is employed by gigantoads, who extend said lengthy and unusually adhesive appendages to capture distant prey. The blue magic rendition utilizes a far more sanitary aetherial “tongue,” but the principle is the same.

,Karlabos performs Tail Screw by collecting turbulent aether in the tip of its tail, then unleashing it at once as a violent whorl that rips foes' lives from their bodies.

,A destructive ability employed by red chocobos wherein the dust and dirt in the area is drawn up into one solid mass, heated until it glows, then dropped on a target from on high. It is unsurprising, then, that these feathery fiends─also known as courser chocobos─are greeted with near-universal terror.

,Embracing rage in the fashion of the spectral berserker allows one to unleash an unbridled wave of destruction. As many a parable will attest, however, anger is a double-edged sword; the spell consumes a great deal of energy, and the caster is advised to be wary of untimely exhaustion.
