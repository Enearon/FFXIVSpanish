2300,Enough! Let's finish this!
2301,"Die! Die! Die! Die a
thousand deaths an'
then die a thousand more!"
2302,You must save us!
2303,"I'm not one of them!
I swear it on what little
remains of my virtue!"
2304,Who are you!?
2305,"What shall it be tonight,
Cap─ You're not the captain!"
2306,"Forgive me, my lord!
I did not mean to offend!"
2307,Am I...free?
2308,"Thank the Twelve!
This nightmare is over!"
2309,"I shan't bite any more...
Just let me out!"
2310,"Mother... Father... What
did I do to deserve this?"
2311,"I don't think I can last
another night in the
Deckhands' Quarters..."
2312,"Please, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>milady<Else/>milord</If>,
I'm ever so sore..."
2313,"Slit them between the
legs! Every last one of them!"
2314,Feel the true power of the Fist!
2315,There is no escape!
2316,Hyaaah!
2317,Rise from the darkness!
2318,Then so shall I.
2319,"If the water were
any deeper, I'd drown!"
2320,"My brain...
I think I boiled it."
2321,"Another word about my
hair, Midlander, and I'll
scalp you right here."
2322,"Can I interest you
ladies in a midnight dip?"
2323,"The springs'll warm from
without, the wine within."
2324,"Care to join us?<If(PlayerParameter(4))><Else/> Or are
you not man enough
for the five of us?</If>"
2325,"It appears we've been
discovered, ladies."
2326,"I can get twice as much
in Ul'dah for half the price!"
2327,"Last stop for supplies
for ten score malms!"
2328,"Five against one,
ye say? Cor!"
2329,"This place has
certainly grown
lively of late."
2330,"These must all be moved
to the Find at once."
2331,"You want this aetheryte,
you have to get by me first!"
2332,"Naught but
weeds, all of it."
2333,"I'm boiling
in this armor."
2334,"The soft flesh under the
jaw. That's their weak spot."
2335,"Feels like I ate
a whole dragon."
2336,"What say you come
over to my bunk, squire?"
2337,I will have my revenge...
2338,"I'd be warmer in
bed with a corpse."
2339,"The visor keeps my
eyes from freezing shut."
2340,"Well, you're obviously not
a giant. You may pass."
2341,"I say we dig
from the north face."
2342,"And I say we
dig from the south."
2343,"Never want for work
in a place as this."
2344,"Look at the masonwork!
The entire structure is
wrought from a single stone!"
2345,"When the fog is thick, I
wouldn't wander too far."
2346,"The Gates are closed to
outsiders and unbelievers."
2347,"Too many adventurers
in Coerthas, I say."
2348,Can you believe it!?
2349,"They're almost as
bad as the dragons."
2350,"Three sacks of winter
wheat and a box of
rotting cabbage will not
see us through a siege."
2351,"Is there naught more to
life than fighting dragons?"
2352,"All I see here is red
and white. The master
requested a rosé!"
2353,"I've satisfied many a
woman in my fifty and
five summers."
2354,"This is why I don't hire
men! You only think with
that head 'twixt your legs!"
2355,"Hah! Yer payin' me
with me own coin!"
2356,"What I wouldn't give to
be down there sipping
rum from a coconut."
2357,"You hear a scream
from the palace?"
2358,"Haven't missed yet.
(The cliff, that is.)"
2359,"One, two... Nine, ten...
Forty-one, forty-two..."
2360,"Seven, eight...hm?
Thirty-nine, forty...hm?"
2361,"Tastes like chicken,
'cause it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> chicken!"
2362,It's all in the wrist!
2363,"The dragons never
rest, nor shall we!"
2364,"My arm... The damned
thing nearly bit it off!"
2365,"The Fury has witnessed
your sacrifice. A place
in Her halls is secure."
2366,"Ten men lost their lives
when you broke the line!"
2367,"My toes...they've all
grown black and cold."
2368,"Halt. State your─
Ah, another adventurer."
2369,"Quiet! You want the
knights to hear you!?"
2370,"Pulled this knife
from her dead hands."
2371,"When in Coerthas, you
must abide by <Emphasis>our</Emphasis> laws."
2372,"Do not dare question
our ways, unbeliever."
2373,"We can continue this no
longer. Think of your wife."
2374,"See that this axle is
greased before nightfall."
2375,"There goes another
heretic off Witchdrop. "
2376,"If it isn't <Emphasis>slaying</Emphasis> dragons
it's <Emphasis>training</Emphasis> to slay them."
2377,"Would you have us face
the Horde unprepared?"
2378,"The weapons within are
those of the fallen."
2379,"Where did I place that
copy of the <Emphasis>Enchiridion</Emphasis>?"
2380,"Unbeliever lies, told to
make us forget our duty."
2381,"They say there's a place
in the south where the
water's warm as blood."
2382,"Quiet, both of you,
and concentrate!"
2383,"An astrologian requires
ample time to ponder the
questions of the heavens."
2384,"I've had enough of the
stale bread, the stale ale,
and the stale company."
2385,"You have a problem
with my company?"
2386,Would you care for a drink?
2387,"All eight were cooked
alive in their armor..."
2388,What of the fellowship?
2389,"What is it? Dragons?
It's <Emphasis>always</Emphasis> dragons..."
2390,"Took me half a lifetime
to find a woman what
could chop wood as good
as Linne."
2391,"But does the hat actually
increase your intelligence?"
2392,"The Horde rarely
descends this far south.
Gigants and goobbues─
those are our bane."
2393,"The Horde will attack
again within the fortnight."
2394,"But the readings
say otherwise!"
2395,"The See must be
made known of this!"
2396,This bodes ill...
2397,"You're a long way
from home, adventurer."
2398,"I do not envy the man
who must patrol the Gaze."
2399,"Nor I, my friend."
2400,"A bottle is missing!
Explain yourselves!"
2401,"No mortal man could
survive such a drop."
2402,"Once the voidsent grab
hold, your soul is theirs."
2403,"Listen to him. Leave this
place and never return."
2404,"You need not fear.
This location is secure."
2405,I am of the third shift.
2406,Fifth shift reporting!
2407,"Seventh shift is
always the worst."
2408,"We work in shifts to
ensure efficiency."
2409,"Another bell and my
shift will be over."
2410,"I'm with the eighth shift.
Or was it the ninth...?"
2411,"I suppose you're
wondering just how
many shifts there are."
2412,"I try not to concern
myself with what
transpires within."
2413,"My shift number?
I don't know. Fourteen?"
2414,"When my shift ends,
I'm going to drink
myself blind."
2415,"The man on fourteenth
was released from service.
I am the new fourteen!"
2416,"Shifts come and go, like
the ebb and flow of the
tides. I am of the fifteenth."
2417,"Neither your life, nor
death, will be forgotten."
2418,"You'd think slayers of
dragons could catch a
bloody rat or two!"
2419,"She's gone... And I
couldn't save her..."
2420,"Come to warm
yourself, too, eh?"
2421,"My new technique? I call
it, Eldritch Bane Thrust!"
2422,Right 'twixt the scales!
2423,"(Then why aren't you
down here with us? Hmph!)"
2424,"They cannot keep
me down here!"
2425,"You've always had
a way with words."
2426,"A gentleman is, rather than does!"
2427,I feel so cultured! I feel so refined!
2428,Am...am I a gentleman yet?
2429,"The moon...eye...
your heart...cry...♪"
2430,None shall return alive...
2431,"The heathen's life is ours, brother."
2432,"Aye, another soul for Lord Ifrit."
2433,As for the remainder of the shipment... 
2434,"I shall see to it forthwith, sir."
2435,Shirk not from the horrors!
2436,Godsdamned voidsent!
2437,"Your blade is welcome, friend."
2438,I beg of you...save my comrades from those terrors.
2439,What is scaredy one waiting for?
2440,This one is ready for you!
2441,Walking one will not leave here alive!
2442,What is scaredy one waiting for?
2443,This one is ready for you!
2444,Walking one will not leave here alive!
2445,"Yer mother was
a Lalafell!"
2446,"To others this is a patty
of ground meat. To me
this is a work of <Emphasis>art</Emphasis>."
2447,"Godsdammit, man! I know you can work faster than that!"
2448,This one needs help!
2449,Let go of this one!
2450,Ick! This one is all sticky!
2451,You are not what I expected...
2452,The warleader commands no weaklings!
2453,These ones must protect these ones' home!
2454,"Be on guard, every one!"
2455,Tee hee!
2456,Ta ha!
2457,Walking one is strong one! This one will leave the rest to strong one!
2458,PUNY MAN! FEEL OUR WRATH!
2459,Stupid ones will never see it coming. Tee hee!
2460,"These ones are smart ones, oh yes."
2461,"You there, on your feet! These paving stones aren't going to lay themselves!"
2462,"For gods' sakes, do I have to do everything myself!?"
2463,"Gods help me, I'm
starting to see paving
stones in my dreams..."
2464,Bleedin' waste of me sword arm...
2465,I don't see anything. Do you?
2466,Only one way to find out...
2467,Go and bugger yourself!
2468,Idiot! Half-wit!
2469,"Here for training,
I take it?"
2470,"Go right on in.
Don't be shy!"
2471,"Not losing your
nerve, I hope?"
2472,"Me infirm grandma
hits harder than ye!"
2473,Put yer hip into it!
2474,"Sir, yes sir!"
2475,To the victor go the spoils!
2476,"Ah, fresh meat for the grinder."
2477,"The meek shall inherit
a hole in the ground!"
2478,"Oh, gods, what've I
gotten myself into..."
2479,"Are you fighting or farting!?
The spectators are like to
laugh themselves to death!"
2480,"If you show your fear,
you've already lost."
2481,"What the hells are you
waiting for? The cavalry!?"
2482,"If I can catch
them unawares..."
2483,There be monsters!
2484,"The eye of the coeurl!
Show it to me!"
2485,"How do you like my
pets? Not too <Emphasis>playful</Emphasis>
for you, I hope?"
2486,"Naught is nobler
than single combat
between gladiators."
2487,"Taking a spear to the
gut is the worst..."
2488,"A gladiator must
know how to pierce
every defense!"
2489,"Without endurance, a
gladiator has nothing."
2490,"Oh, gods, make it end... I've
got nothin' left to bring up..."
2491,"Why work when sleep
feels so good? Rest...
Slumber... Zzz..."

2540,"Look, children!
An adventurer!"
2541,"Do you have your
own magitek armor?"

was as reliable as
an adventurer."

an adventurer
when I grow up!"

Bombards fly!"
2555,"Ooh, a real adventurer!"

About damn time!"

monster, it is!"
2619,If this is another boot...
2620,"The one that got
away, my arse!"
2621,"Master SephiroxXx will be
delighted with today's catch!"
2622,Kelp... Always kelp...
2623,"A fine specimen, this is!"
2624,Just one more...
2625,"Well, well!
What do we have here?"
2626,"This'll fetch
a fine price."
2627,Another decent find.
2628,"I've fallen headfirst into
the Matron's bosom!"
2629,"I'd risk a moment of
rest but you never know
when Master is watching..."
2630,"Step back, friend. That
spot is already claimed."
2631,"This take should stay
Master's hand tonight."
2632,I am INVINCIBLE!
2633,"The Spinner smiles on
you this day, friend."
2634,"Who needs luck when
you have skill to spare?"
2635,"Might be I've time to wet
me lips on a warm ale."
2636,"Appears this area's
been picked clean."
2637,Where to next?
2638,"Nothing like sweat on the
brow to soothe the soul."
2639,Another...and another...and...!
2640,"I wouldn't call myself a
natural, but I'm a natural!"
2641,"One for Master...
(One for me...)"
2642,"As easy as taking
candy from a rock!"
2643,"Never have I
labored so hard..."
2644,"Take my word. The land
here will yield no more."
2645,"Finally! I can return home
to my children at last!"
2646,"Must you call
every quarter bell?"
2647,"Not here to steal
my spot now, are you?"
2648,"Another call? I wonder
what he wants this time..."
2649,"Ten bells and
not a single bite..."
2650,"Enough with the fries...
I'm here for a king!"
2651,You're mine now!
2652,"The bloody thing's
a good yalm across!"
2653,"Freedom earned
with a dragon!"
2654,"I've caught nothing
here but the chills."
2655,Well met!
2656,Anything bite?
2657,"Venturing requires all <Emphasis>six</Emphasis>
senses. Yes, I said <Emphasis>six</Emphasis>."
2658,"Mind your step. 'Tis a
long way to the bottom."
2659,Pray help our child!
2660,"Open your eyes, son! Please!"
2661,"Hoho, a handy blade for each hand!"
2662,"Is that it?
What else can you tell me?"
2663,"They're soddin' late.
Again."
2664,I'm bloody starvin'...
2665,I need me some new stabbers...
2666,What's our next job?
2667,"Ooh, I love me a good scrap!"
2668,"I dunno what's goin' on
but let's see some blood!"
2669,"Yes, this should
last us for a while..."
2670,Zzz... Zzz... Kwehzzz...
2671,"We'll never...
be...apart... Zzz..."
2672,A glass of our vilest piss.
2673,"One watered wine and one
warm milk. Anything else?"
2674,Have you decided yet?
2675,"Your wine, madam.
A Fifth Astral Era vintage."
2676,Heh heh. Coming right up.
2677,"Keep the drinks coming!
And put it on <Emphasis>his</Emphasis> tab!"
2678,"A glass of your best wine!
And make it quick, woman."
2679,"Only a Fifth? I suppose it
will have to do. Begone now."
2680,Three... Two... One...
2681,"Welcome to the
Manderville Gold Saucer!"
2682,"Escape reality,
live the fantasy!"
2683,"But I don't want to
work in the silver mines!"
2684,"It's only for a few moons.
Then my debt will be paid."
2685,"You going to let her
take your money like that?"
2686,"The stroke... The follow-
through... That boy truly
knows how to handle a ball..."
2687,"Today's my lucky day!
Or perhaps tomorrow!"
2688,"Pipe down, boy. Can't
ye see I'm thinkin'?"
2689,"Beggary is frowned upon
at our fine establishment."
2690,"I'm afraid we're going to
have to ask you to leave."
2691,"All I need is ten more MGP!
You know I'm good for it!"
2692,"Everything in this place is
so massive! I wonder if
the owner is attempting to
compensate for something."
2693,"After you, my dear."
2694,"No, after you. I insist."
2695,"Knavery is unnecessary
when matching wits with
the likes of you."
2696,"Them some right baggin'
sleeves you 'ave there."
2697,Did I win again?
2698,"But... But... You said this
was your first time playing!"
2699,"A little more to the left...
Now up! No, back! Right!
Stop! Stop! Stop!"
2700,I'll never best that Teioh!
2701,"Da! I'm hungry
and I miss Ma and Sis!"
2702,"Can someone─anyone─
show me to the privy? I'm
like to explode!"
2703,"Look! It's a senior
saber...something!"
2704,"Every merchant worth his
salt is watchin' ceruleum."
2705,"There's a mad scramble
to buy ceruleum!"
2706,"Ought I invest, I wonder?"
2707,"I'll make my fortune in
ceruleum─see if I don't!"
2708,<sniff> I want my mammy!
2709,"Ugh, noisy bloody brat.
Can't be rid of it soon
enough..."
2710,Over here! Over here!
2711,"This seat is taken,
if you were wondering."
2712,"What exactly were we
looking for again, Father?"
2713,"“El Coloso” means
“the Coloso.”"
2714,"<swoon>
You know everything!"
2715,"Sting like a butterfly,
float like a tree!"
2716,"Here's what I think
of yer twenty-bell
shifts, taskmaster!"
2717,"Stop that yapping or <Emphasis>I'll</Emphasis>
show you a moogle's paw!"
2718,"Don't you think if there
was more to life than
lugging crates, I'd be doing it!?"
2719,"That sabotender told me
there was fish in here!"
2720,"How's about another
go at her, eh?"
2721,I can see the top!
2722,"What in the seven
hells was that thing?"
2723,"A cucumber, I think."
2724,"Did you see him try
and touch me bum?"
2725,"Where am I? I just
want to go home..."
2726,"No pets allowed, my arse."
2727,"And then he
went...FUNGAH!!!"
2728,Fungah!?
2729,What does that even mean?
2730,"You think you have
what it takes to be <Emphasis>the</Emphasis>
Lords of the Dance!?"
2731,"You bloody lot move
like sotted jellyfish!"
2732,"No, no!
You have it all wrong!"
2733,"Sir! Yes, sir!"
2734,"Four simple motions. Is
that so hard to remember!?"
2735,"Close your eyes, darling.
They cannot see you if
you cannot see them."
2736,"Why is everyone
staring at us, Bradford?"
2737,"My lucky numbers?
Why, 1234, of course!"
2738,"A kiss for good luck?
That'll be 50 MGP."
2739,"Rig away! I've won
three drawings straight!"
2740,"I can't win a thing...
I'm starting to think
the lots are rigged."
2741,"You'd best not let one of
the attendants hear you..."
2742,"You mean waiting here
won't see the drawing
any earlier!?"
2743,"And by “approximately”
you mean “exactly,” right?"
2744,"By my calculations, you
have approximately a 1 in
10,000 chance of winning."
2745,"Don't ask me what's
in this crate. Just don't."
2746,"That uniform serves only
to objectify and is an
insult to her inner beauty!"
2747,"Any complaints regarding
staff attire can be taken
up with the management."
2748,"Anything you need, love?"
2749,Top off your glass?
2750,"How 'bout a hammer an'
nails for to clap shut
this windbag's flappin' gob?"
2751,"The young master does
not require any further
refreshment, thank you."
2752,"Rumor is it's
anatomically correct."
2753,That's quite the statue...
2754,"I heard the Saucer's kitchens
claim all abandoned chocobos."
2755,"No wonder there are so
many chicken dishes!"
2756,"Acceleration is the key
to victory, I tell you."
2757,"Only a clever bird will
claim the laurels, my boys."
2758,"Nimble feet amount to
naught without the
stamina to drive them!"
2759,"I wonder if I have time for
a swing at Cuff-a-Cur
before the next race..."
2760,"It's alright, Boko.
The people here will
take good care of you."
2761,"Old enough to waddle,
old enough to race."
2762,"Thank the heavens you've
come! Now, let us split up
and save our friends' tails!"
2763,"Well, <Emphasis>I'm</Emphasis> the one
who procured the
rarest of ores!"
2764,"Why don't we leave
these others to their
squabbling, hm?"
2765,You'd best watch your tongue!
2766,"He said that <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> was
his favorite muse!"
2767,Miqo'te manstealer!
2768,What of the city!?
2769,Its defenses are impenetrable!
2770,"Nay, we must not be overconfident..."
2771,The soldiers are unsettled...
2772,Then you must settle them!
2773,Understood!
2774,"You've all come!
Thank you..."
2775,"How could we not?
Your homeland is in peril!"
2776,I should not have left the Toll...
2777,Where are our reinforcements?
2778,"Will we be allowed into
the city, I wonder..."
2779,Thank the gods you're here!
2780,D-Damn dragons!
2781,Lend your blade to Ishgard!
2782,"We fight as one!
For all Eorzeans!"
2783,"Why do they call it a
square if the hall's round?"
2784,"Ask your mother, boys."
2785,"Cactpot!
I'm rich! I'm rich!"
2786,My thanks...
2787,"I wouldn't have got caught
if you'd stayed hidden!"
2788,"I would've stayed hidden if
you hadn't kept looking at me!"
2789,"We'll never win the Durai
Memorial if you two don't
learn to work together."
2790,"I suppose this spot
is as good as any!"
2791,"What a wonderful view of...
whatever those things are."
2792,"My patrons cannot stop
talking of Rowena's new
terrace, so I came to see
what all the fuss is about."
2793,"Hmph. I'll reserve
me judgment till I've
swallowed the grog."
2794,"Looks as if ol' Rowena's
more'n a few gil to spare."
2795,"I deem this establishment
fit for a Manderville man!"
2796,"I'll have to see about
having some of those
sent to the guild."
2797,"A decent terrace, <Emphasis>if</Emphasis> you
enjoy these sort of things."
2798,"'Ow was the bloody grog?
So good, I cannot recall!"
2799,"No love for poor
Gerolt here, I reckon."
2800,"Your advice was worth
its weight in gold, milady!"
2801,"How fare the sales
of Ironworks goods?"
2802,"But think of what people
will say when they learn
that's where it's from!"
2803,"I can see clearly now,
the rain is gone!"
2804,"Lower tables
would've been nice..."
2805,"Lady Rowena will not
suffer riffraff in her
new establishment."
2806,"If you have to ask, you're
not supposed to know."
2807,"Come one, come all! The
glory of the tourney awaits!"
2808,"Lord Manderville pays
me to carry crates,
so I carry crates."
2809,"Is there a letter in
your bag for me?"
2810,"I-I have something I
must needs ask you!"
2811,I-I do! I mean...what?
2812,"Is it wrong of us to know
such happiness?"
2813,"Happiness can never be
wrong, my love."
2814,"This time, he will be mine..."
2815,I-I-I... I l-l-l-l-l-lov─
2816,"Calm down, calm down!
Take a deep breath
and start again."
2817,"What do you want for
Valentione's Day?"
2818,"Just you, my darling."
2819,Why does she not write!?
2820,"So, did you get anything
for Valentione's Day?"
2821,"No card, no chocolate.
Nothing..."
2822,"Just go over and give it
to him, you daft sod!"
2823,I can't! I'm not ready! 
2824,"A true man is <Emphasis>defined</Emphasis>
by his muscle... Bwahahaha!"
2825,"See how the oil glistens in
the light of the crystals?"
2826,Our eyes met!
2827,Ouch! What was that!?
2828,"Nowhere to run now, Spriggy!
Nowhere to hide!"
2829,"You ain't getting away
from us this time!"
2830,Bags I a leg!
2831,"Big, big eggiiies!
Lucky, lucky treasuuure!!!"
2832,"Why would these fiends
trespass against us?"
2833,"Where have all the
rolanberry cheesecakes gone?♪"
2834,Mayhap I'm just too demanding...♪
2835,"Dream, if you will, a stage...♪"
2836,I am something you'll never understand...♪
2837,"A body like yours
ought to be in gaol...♪"
2838,"Feel the heat
between me and you...♪"
2839,"This is what it sounds like
when chocobos kweh...♪"
2840,"Have you ever seen
such a beautiful animal?"
2841,"Crash and boom
and bangy doom.♪
Tastybird, we eat
you soon.♪"
2842,"Boom and crash
and doomy dash.♪
Tastyegg we
crack and smash.♪"
2843,"Be on your guard.
He is yet close..."
2844,"There's naught like a long
drag on the pipe here to
calm a man's nerves after
a day fittin' blast caps."
2845,"Man!? You've not seen a
day past ten summers!
Now pass the bloody briar
afore I whack you one good."
2846,<belch>
2847,"Gahahaha! Somebody bring
this boy another round!
His first be runnin' down
his britches!"
2848,"Thal's balls, man!
Stop wastin' good ale
on a whelp what'll just
disgorge 'er gutterwise!"
2849,"Even the mutton down in
Stone's Throw'll cost ye.
Might be a toss o' the
bones'd line yer linty purse."
2850,"Are you suggesting I
use ill-gotten coin to
purchase the services of
a local courtesan? PAH, I say!"
2851,"Fight, my friends! Fight!"
2852,O Halone...
2853,"Finish them!
Finish them!"
2854,Heathen scum!
2855,Ser Grinnaux!
2856,Get them!
2857,"This way, quickly!"
2858,Well done!
2859,An impressive performance!
2860,"Sway like a cobra, strike like a viper..."
2861,I must always look my best!
2862,I feel extra fierce in this mask!
2863,I need some matching earrings...
2864,"Hells, that thing was fast..."
2865,I hope nobody saw us...
2866,I thought we were done for...
2867,We'll beat it this time!
2868,Onwards to victory...with style!
2869,"Ah, my beloved Halone..."
2870,"Begone, netherlings!
These are Vundu lands!"
2871,Bastards...
2872,If only...
2873,Dammit...
2874,"I worry not, for with every
dawn comes a new day."
2875,"I recall you from the
battle on the Steps!"
2876,"Your bravery shall
not soon be forgotten."
2877,"This is only until
F'lhaminn returns."
2878,"You fool! I warned you
not to drink too deep!"
2879,<rumble> <rumble>
2880,Graaargggh!
2881,"Gather one, gather all!
The show is about to begin!"
2882,"This I learned from the
Songstress of Ul'dah herself!"
2883,For my next number...
2884,"Thank you! Thank you!
You are all too kind!"
2885,Bollocks...
2886,How could such a wee thing be so strong!?
2887,"Tossed us about like a rag doll, she did!"
2888,"I have a few questions, if I may..."
2889,Might I trouble you for a moment...?
2890,The things I do for coin and country...
2891,Am I holding this thing right?
2892,Agh! I nearly had one!
2893,The bloody things just won't bite...
2894,"Thank the gods!
Help's finally arrived!"
2895,Impossible...
2896,Ugh...
2897,You're mine!
2898,My thanks...
2899,That was close...
2900,Have at you!
2901,Damn their thick hides!
2902,Yaaargh!
2903,"What's the shortest way back, I wonder?"
2904,Keep an eye out for falling rocks!
2905,Prospecting looks a right chore.
2906,I'll bet you'd work up a right sweat digging.
2907,"Up, up, up it goes, then down, down, down!"
2908,I hope there's ore hereabouts.
2909,"Whew, that's one sharp drop."
2910,Isn't the ore on the inside?
2911,"<buzzzzzz>
Sector clear..."
2912,"Per...orming...diagn...sti...
<buzzzzzz>"
2913,"Error! Error!
Core failure imminent!"
2914,"Welcome to Azys Lla.
Please form two lines
and await processing."
2915,"Heretics! Someone
call the guard!"
2916,"Take your fortune-
telling elsewhere!"
2917,"Don't let the beauty of this
place fool you. Even the
flowers would see you dead."
2918,I shall sleep well tonight!
2919,"He's not coming back, love..."
2920,Baa! Baa!
2921,Bleeeaaat!
2922,"I've been scattering marl
so long, I cannot even
remember when I started!"
2923,"Gods, how I hate cabbage..."
2924,"Which end was I supposed
to look into again?"
2925,"Fish in sea are like stars
in heavens─ever bountiful!"
2926,"Then why can
you catch none?"
2927,Rain!
2928,Sky!
2929,Life!
2930,"Open this door or I'll...
Or I'll... Gah! Just open it!"
2931,"'Tweren't for these
goggles, our eyes'd freeze
solid! I've seen it happen!"
2932,"We'll need six score nails,
ten score lengths of ash...
Are you getting all this?"
2933,"Don't tell me it's frozen to
the cobbles. I'm not falling
for <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> one again!"
2934,"I have no idea how I'm
going to get down..."
2935,"Good-bye, cruel world!"
2936,Damned powder snow...
2937,I think I see a mountain!
2938,"Six bells!? The foreman'll
have me head!"
2939,"It's straight to the pallet
for me tonight... After an
ale or six, of course."
2940,<belch>
2941,"Gahahaha! Somebody bring
this boy another round!
His first be runnin' down
his britches!"
2942,"Thal's balls, man!
Stop wastin' good brew
on a whelp what'll just
disgorge 'er gutterwise!"
2943,"You must unlearn what
you have learned."
2944,"What do you <Emphasis>mean</Emphasis>,
“There is no try”?"
2945,"Just what the
colonel ordered."
2946,"Quiet! I'll not have you
frighten off my quarry!"
2947,<click> <click>
2948,"In or out? <click>
<click> Out or in?"
2949,I won't let them eat you.
2950,"If I lose another 'bo to
those yetis, I'll be ruined."
2951,Whew...
2952,We're in your debt.
2953,May I have a moment?
2954,Make it quick.
2955,Just a few more malms...
2956,"Cut my hand with this
damned knife. Captain
says no hunting till it heals."
2957,"The colder it grows, the
bolder the heretics become."
2958,Zzz... Zzz... <snort> Zzz...
2959,"Zzz... Mog be nimble...
Mog be quick... Zzz..."
2960,"I can't stop, kupo!"
2961,"Zzz... If I could only eat
in my sleep, kupo... Zzz..."
2962,A flying landlord!?
2963,"You like my axe? You
can't have it, kupo!"
2964,"You'll see me a knight
afore you see me
swing a sledge."
2965,"Just leave me, Sister."
2966,"What were you thinking,
coming back out here
before your wounds healed?"
2967,"It's colder than a
dragon's stare out there!"
2968,"“Lift with the legs,”
she said. Bah!"
2969,"I could use that pickaxe
over here, Midlander."
2970,"Even the mutton down in
the Brume'll cost ye.
Might be a toss o' the
bones'd line yer linty purse."
2971,"Are you suggesting I
use ill-gotten coin to
purchase the services of
a local courtesan? Pah, I say!"
2972,"They're all dead...and it
was me who killed 'em!"
2973,"Why do I even bother?
It will only be demolished
again in the next raid..."
2974,"This won't be
nearly enough..."
2975,"I'll take two of everything.
In gold <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> silver!"
2976,Is this a “P” or an “R”?
2977,"Maybe if you had studied
your letters instead of
playing Knights & Knaves
we'd have our lemoncakes."
2978,"Might you have aught
for boils, miss? Big ones."
2979,"You need more than
an endorsement to enter
the seminary, you know."
2980,"It feels as if we've
waited here an eternity!"
2981,"You need not speak while
in the chapel, for the Fury
can hear the whispers of
your soul."
2982,"What lies beyond is not
for the eyes of an unbeliever."
2983,"Your skin is like the snow,
your eyes like sapphires!"
2984,"These stars won't align for
another seventy lunations."
2985,"Why can't the viscount
put anything away...?"
2986,"The star has changed its
magnitude from four to five!"
2987,"But a moon in the
kitchens and the maid is
already fat with child!"
2988,"How much longer must we
wait? You, fetch me a drink."
2989,"The gobbiehall will see
overmuch feasting and
trading of tongueflaps!"
2990,"Warmfeet and warmfish
and water that's clean.♪
Bigsky and tongue-tie,
a good gobbie's dream.♪"
2991,"The better the boom,
the bigger the doom!"
2992,"It's quieter than the
Toll, I'll give it that."
2993,"A summoning bell...?
Dare I ring it...just once?"
2994,"There's naught like a long
drag on the pipe here to
calm a man's nerves after
a day fittin' blast caps."
2995,"Man!? You've not seen a
day past twelve summers!
Now pass the bloody briar
afore I whack you one good."
2996,Don't look down!
2997,Zzz...
2998,Which way was escape tunnel?
2999,"Flipp'er over, flip flip!"
3000,"Emit PDN, ammo-ct xet."
3001,"I hear you've found
some new housing."
3002,Again with the head shot!
3003,"Maybe next year they'll
let me carry sacks!"
3004,Neuro-what?
3005,"Are you certain this
neurolink is on tight?"
3006,"What comes after white
and black? Red, I say!"
3007,Red!? Don't you mean blue!?
3008,"What evils would bring
together two primals, a
behemoth, and a bomb!? "
3009,"Er......
Can I have three guesses?"
3010,"Now where did I put that
clockwork Doomtrain?"
3011,"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here...
Oh, I'm only kidding!"
3012,"What!? Did you say some-
thing!? I can't hear you!"
3013,♪～♪
3014,I need my daily dose of minions...
3015,"Ah, such adorable violence..."
3016,Get away!
3017,Let's play pirates an' planks!
3018,"Calm down, you!"
3019,Shut your mouth!
3020,What's that!?
3021,Got somethin' to say!?
3022,Bunch of ne'er-do-wells...
3023,"Lemoncakes, I'm scared..."
3024,We should be fine over here.
3025,Never let me go!
3026,Pick up your garbage!
3027,Hold yer damn tongue!
3028,Show me yer moves!
3029,Ye got some gall!
3030,I'm lovin' it!
3031,How pretty!
3032,If it's you...
3033,"Godsdamn, that smarts!"
3034,"Blood, it's blood!"
3035,Haha!
3036,Hehehe!
3037,"So, do you like...stuff?"
3038,Go away!
3039,I'll never give you up!
3040,Mwahah!
3041,"Party time, excellent!"
3042,How's thiiis!?
3043,"Come on, you can jump higher than that!"
3044,The docks are lovely today...
3045,"Overwhelming numbers!
That's the best strategy!"
3046,"I'll let him think he's winning...
Then BAM! Hee hee!"
3047,She's usually such a sweet girl...
3048,I'm very particular about my forces!
3049,Oh? How so?
3050,Every minion is a mandragora!
3051,"Uh...
And that helps you win?"
3052,"I spent all my MGP
on you, mate.
So we better win!"
3053,Squeee!
3054,I think we're alone now...
3055,How horrid...
3056,I want to get my feet wet!
3057,I love fireworks!
3058,I want to be an adventurer!
3059,Hurry! I want to go scare my sister!
3060,Can I have my costume now?
3061,"Come on, do it! I'm here! Do it now!"
3062,Where. Is. My. Costume!?
3063,Sweets! Sweets! <Emphasis>Sweeeeeets</Emphasis>!
3064,This better not be a trick!
3065,I love me some plunder...
3066,Too easy!
3067,"Hello again,
old friend..."
3068,"...It doesn't get any easier,
does it."
3069,"It's...it's all gone.
Everything... Gone..."
3070,I have the watch!
3071,I...I just don't...
3072,"Pull yourself together!
We'll find a way! We always do!"
3073,Something is amiss...
3074,Eat! Eat until stomach swells!
3075,Eenu Vanu outdoes himself again!
3076,"Let's be off, eh?"
3077,"Ah, it's you."
3078,"Even a sky pirate needs
a break from excitement.
From time to time."
3079,"I'm taking aether readings.
You know, for the ghost ship!"
3080,"These values...
They're different from before."
3081,That bleedin' ship...
3082,Rumors are our meat and mead.
3083,"Can't enjoy me drink with
this scrag yappin' in me ear..."
3084,Bah! This place is dry.
3085,"I love it when
a plan comes together!"
3086,"Well...it hasn't come
together till the beast's
in me belly."
3087,"I could've sworn I forgot
to bait the trap... Oh well."
3088,Another day's work done.
3089,"I'm so hungry, I could eat...
well, almost anything."
3090,That smells heavenly!
3091,
3092,Hee hee hee!
3093,Heretic! Kinslayer!
3094,"O Halone, we beseech You!"
3095,"Die, damn you, die!"
3096,Are you injured?
3097,It's over now...
3098,Fury be praised...
3099,"Put your back into it!
We've ten score more of
these to clear by noon!"
3100,"Why don't we ever hire
anyone who can wield
cobble-laying magicks?"
3101,"Pshkohhh...
Bigger! Higher!
Build, build, build!"
3102,"I've a feeling I'm
going to regret taking
Lady Rowena's coin..."
3103,"Your father has already
given his consent. We are
to be married on the eve
of the new moon."
3104,"Yes, my lord."
3105,"Why am I not allowed say
in mine own affairs...?"
3106,"I am a woman grown, yet
Father would treat me as
if I were a swaddling babe."
3107,"You look pale, milady.
Is aught amiss?"
3108,Might I be of some assistance?
3109,"A fine gobbiemask, that is!"
3110,"A fine gobbiemask, indeed!"
3111,"I've come from Ul'dah
to learn the ways
of your people!"
3112,"Gobbie mindfruit is ripe
for bellyfilling! Here,
halflegs! Take a bite!"
3113,"Ah... Very well, then."
3114,"You'll see, Mother.
You'll see."
3115,"Hope it's not
like last time..."
3116,"When's the dragon
going to come?"
3117,"But what if the baby
comes early?"
3118,"What I wouldn't give to
look behind the curtain."
3119,"Slay the stinky intruders!
Ugh, the smell!"
3120,"They've a trick or two
up their sleeves.
I'm sure of it."
3121,"Bah! We've the pride
of three nations.
What have they got!?"
3122,"<click> <click> 
(You saw it, yes?)"
3123,(Hush. The deftarm will hear.)
3124,I have fulfilled my duty.
3125,<click> <click> Very good. We have your reward.
3126,"It's not gysahl greens, is it?"
3127,We've come across some news that may interest your guild.
3128,<click> <click> Do tell. We are eager to hear it.
3129,"Well, ain't that somethin'."
3130,Was that stone dragon always there?
3131,The dragons permitted us to take it. A sign of parley.
3132,"Parley with dragons!? 
Ne'er thought I'd see the day!"
3133,Your procurement of firesand has arrived.
3134,<click> <click> The Nonmind are grateful.
3135,"Gobbies finish boomstick! 
New type, more boom!"
3136,"And we have nanka eggs, special for you. 
We aged them. Especially juicy."
3137,"Got a dangerous task for ye.  
Is the guild up for a challenge?"
3138,<click> <click> We do not fear the wilds.
3139,"I am a mentor, my good
fellow! And there are no
foolish questions!"
3140,"Well, in that case..."
3141,That final exercise is murderous...
3142,"Someone...er...
lend me a hand?"
3143,"They haven't even told
me what we're building."
3144,"Calling all prospective
engineers!"
3145,"Gobbie mindfruit is ripe
for bellyfilling! Come
take a bite!"
3146,"Rippling Rainlander! Crave
you gobbie clevering?"
3147,"My mind is a bottomless
well waiting to be filled."
3148,"Uh... Not sure sense is
being made...but you can
have a gobbiemask!"
3149,"I wonder what Lady Rowena
has in store for this place?"
3150,"I heard she's thinking of
expanding her selection
of Garlean goods..."
3151,"I've lived here my whole
life, yet there are so many
places I've never seen!"
3152,"And I shall show you
them all, my lady."
3153,"Thank you for allowing a
caged songbird to fly free...
even if only for an afternoon."
3154,"I did naught but unhinge
the lock. It was you who
chose to spread her wings."
3155,"And still, here I am,
alighted once again on
my father's perch."
3156,"Then make this
the last time!"
3157,"Meet me tonight beneath
the Architects!"
3158,Whatever should I do?
3159,"I knew from first we met
that we were meant for
each other."
3160,"Come! Let us leave all
this behind and start
our lives anew!"
3161,"Yes, my love! Yes!"
3162,"The baronet will wish
to know of this treachery!"
3163,"Mother asked us to fetch
mutton and popotoes. She
said nothing of honey cakes."
3164,"Right! She <Emphasis>didn't</Emphasis> say
we <Emphasis>couldn't</Emphasis> buy any!"
3165,"Well, that was fast."
3166,Proceed to the next quarter!
3167,"Keep goin', keep goin'!"
3168,Brother! Pull yourself together!
3169,Somehow I'm still alive...
3170,You're mine!
3171,Taste the cold steel!
3172,I won't let you get away!
3173,You're bold to take on the 'Cudas!
3174,Ware those who lurk in the shadows!
3175,Now!
3176,Feel my blades' sting!
3177,I-Incredible...
3178,We've grown...too complacent...
3179,Isn't this a bit excessive?
3180,Have at you!
3181,"Come on, is that all you've got?"
3182,"Raaargh!
I'm all fired up!"
3183,I'll blow you away!
3184,The waves part to my cleave!
3185,Promise me ye won't lose to that perfumed sack o' shite up ahead.
3186,"This has been very...informative.
Until next time."
3187,"黒渦は、
すべてを呑み込む！"
3188,"避けねば
大怪我では済まんぞ？"
3189,でりゃあああああ！
3190,足下がガラ空きだ！
3191,"多勢に無勢なのだ
卑怯とは言わせんぞ？"
3192,これが海賊王の荒技よ！
3193,"大砲用の火薬樽だ…
扱いには気を付けな！"
3194,"Bwahahaha!
Seems like ages since I felt this alive!"
3195,"Well fought. Mayhap you will
have the pleasure of
facing me one day."
3196,"You see that shadow?
Airship? Or bird?"
3197,"Need to save my strength.
Haulin' treasure's hard work,
you know!"
3198,"Zzz... Gold...
Lovely, glitterin' gold..."
3199,Come to stretch your wings?
3200,"Take a seat, eh?
Put your feet up."
3201,"How do they get
so damn <Emphasis>muddy</Emphasis>!?"
3202,"A full sixmoon of toil, and I
still haven't a gil to me name!"
3203,"Yet the young maid at the
tavern seems to be faring
well, I see. Heh heh."
3204,"C-Careful, my dear,
that one was a bit
below the belt..."
3205,Pow! Right in the kisser!
3206,Fascinating...
3207,"<Emphasis>Alchemy 101</Emphasis>?
Are there a hundred
other such tomes?"
3208,"If you need brute strength,
then I'm your girl!"
3209,"The Fury aid me...
I cannot stop shaking..."
3210,"Come, then, you fiends!
I'll not let my family burn!"
3211,"When they come at you,
remember your drills."
3212,"Stay with me!
...Damnable dragons."
3213,How's the <Emphasis>Raimille</Emphasis> lookin'?
3214,"In great shape, Captain!
Not a squeak to be heard!"
3215,"Have to keep my girl
in perfect condition..."
3216,"We're ready to
fly at any time!"
3217,"Hmm... Odd
little bugger..."
3218,"Wherefore art thou,
Inspector Cyr..."
3219,Inspector Cyr! Inspector Cyr!
3220,"Pshhh... Shkohhh...
Still out and about?"
3221,"The trading of tongueflaps
is of frontmost import!
A place of trading them
is of middlemost!"
3222,"It's hotter than Ifrit's arse
after a peck of dragon peppers."
3223,"Smack whack crack
wham bang bonk boom!
Gob building new fancy room!"
3224,"Pshkohhh...
Lower! Deeper!
Drop, drop, drop!"
3225,"Pshhh... Shkohhh...
Brainfruit must have
proper lockbox."
3226,"This smells like a revolution.
Is this a revolution? Can we
make it a revolution?"
3227,"How dare that harlot spurn
me for a filthy commoner!"
3228,"I have brought milord a
man who claims he can
be of help...for a price."
3229,"Coin is no object. I only
wish the lady returned
unharmed. As for the cur...
do with him as you see fit."
3230,"Yes, yer lordship."
3231,"Come now, you'll have
to do better than that!"
3232,"If they come again,
I will handle them!"
3233,"The world just keeps on spinning and spinning, kupo..."
3234,"I think I'm going to be sick, kupo..."
3235,"She will come to her
senses once she realizes
she has no other choice."
3236,"Of course, Milord."
3237,"Hand over the lass and
we can all go home happy."
3238,"Tell the baronet to come
here and face me himself!"
3239,"We haven't the coin to
buy the mutton! If Mother
learns of this, she'll take
the switch to both of us!"
3240,"I <Emphasis>told</Emphasis> you we shouldn't
have gotten those honey cakes!"
3241,Now what do we do...?
3242,"There's a poor girl what
weeps by the fountain
every night..."
3243,Enough! I beg of you!
3244,"Mama and Papa...
They still haven't come back."
3245,Meep...
3246,Have you seen Master Mogzin? He owes me kupo nuts!
3247,Ah... That feels good...
3248,"Step outside Bahrr Lehs at your own peril, kupo!"
3249,So hot... So tired...
3250,"Come on, put your pom into it!"
3251,"No, not there, not there!"
3252,Hmmm... That doesn't look right...
3253,"Does that look level to you, kupo?"
3254,"So warm, kupo. It's like there's a fire in your belly."
3255,"I can just lose myself in the music, kupo!"
3256,"Is it twirl, jump, twirl or twirl, twirl, jump?"
3257,Have you ever seen something so heartwarming?
3258,"I...I can't feel my pom, kupo."
3259,I'll let you guys finish the rest.
3260,We'll never finish at this rate.
3261,"I'm not going to make it, kupo..."
3262,"Hey! Umph...wait for me, kupo!"
3263,I want to see if I can reach the top...
3264,Didn't Mogek want us back soon?
3265,I should've known it was too good to be true...
3266,"Revenge <cough> will be ours, kupo!"
3267,And why are we here again?
3268,"Because Rowena'd have
our heads on a shelf
selling for scrips if we weren't."
3269,Oi! You have enough nails!?
3270,"Do I look like I need any
more nails!?"
3271,The Mogmenders are safe under our protection!
3272,This place is quite...pleasant.
3273,I envy the grace with which they move.
3274,Perhaps this arrangement with the sons of man is not so bad. 
3275,To think working with dragons could be so pleasurable.
3276,
3277,
3278,Wherever did that crate disappear to?
3279,<mumble> <mumble>
3280,"That's not death, you fool!
It's just some passerby!"
3281,"Ahhh! See!? See!?
Death stalks us
at every turn!"
3282,"Pshhh... Shkohhh...
Grand Sers! Grand Sers!
This is final warning!"
3283,"Happy Starlight, friend! Won't you help us work miracles?"
3284,"Starlight, star bright! Help us bring good cheer to the children tonight!"
3285,'Tis Starlight season! Care to help us spread happiness and joy?
3286,"Oh yes, I like me men
on their hands and knees!"
3287,"You take all laudtalks for
design, I take all jinglyshine!"
3288,"Yes, I suppose you cannot
spell “automaton” without
“a tomato.”"
3289,"I cannot see worth a
damn in this wretched thing!"
3290,"Pssst!
(I ran out of water a bell
ago...but the cropmaster
don't have to know, eh?)"
3291,"Naught more stimulatin'
than watchin' pumpkins
grow, I reckon."
3292,"Calling all prospective
engineers!"
3293,"Gobbie mindfruit is ripe
for bellyfilling! Come
take a bite!"
3294,"Ravishing Rainlander! Crave
you succulent secrets of
automaton cogbonding?"
3295,"Might someone lend me
a hand? Anyone? ANYONE!?"
3296,"Higher! Taller!
Bigger! Larger!"
3297,"The barony's coffers are
deep, my dear. You will
want for naught in this life."
3298,"My lord, we must straight
back. Your father will wish
to discuss the dowry."
3299,Wait!
3300,"Begone.
The Pillars is no place
for one of your standing."
3301,"Ah, if it isn't the lowborn
wretch who fancies himself
the good lady's suitor.
Summon the constable."
3302,"You can throw me in the
darkest of oubliettes, and
cast the key to the clouds.
Our love will not fade."
3303,"But will that love fill her
belly? Will it wrap her in
the finest of Eastern silks?"
3304,"I yearn not for those things
you associate with happiness..."
3305,"...for without the love of
dear Peter, they would
provide mine heart little solace."
3306,"If it would please you to
see me live a lie─to look
into my dead eyes each
morn─then fine. I am yours."
3307,"But is that truly a more
lamentable fate than
looking into no eyes at all?"
3308,"No. I was a fool to think
I could reason with a
<Emphasis>woman in love</Emphasis>.
Leave me. Both of you."
3309,Thank you...milord.
3310,"Reginald. You know
what I must ask of you..."
3311,You should still be abed...
3312,"My next ship?
Needs to be faster."
3313,"I'll see to it, Captain!"
3314,"Swifter than swift, you hear?"
3315,...Not sturdier?
3316,"Ain't no one keepin' up
with the Redbills!"
3317,Keepin' yourself in trouble?
3318,"I'm meant to be working, but...
Please don't tell Stacia!"
3319,"I do not understand why,
yet I feel oddly at home here."
3320,"Right, then.
Time for a spot of plunder..."
3321,These playful movements...they intrigue me.
3322,Tee hee hee! They can't take their eyes off me!
3323,The most important thing is that everyone leaves happy!
3324,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience! Let's make this a Little Ladies' Day to remember!"
3325,Encore! Encore! Encore...!
3326,What adorable costumes!
3327,"I still pack backthoughts
of earlytimes in Idyllshire..."
3328,"Overmany quillwords see
gobbiebrain abursting!"
3329,"Decease and insist!
Beyond shutport lies
secrets unmeant for
uplander wide-eyes!"
3330,"Come! Downsit with gob
and longpeer the seasky!"
3331,"It might help if I had some
ink to go with this quill."
3332,"No longer calling all
prospective engineers!"
3333,"Gobbie mindfruit tree is
plucked to barebottoms!"
3334,"Oh Father, what have I done?
How am I to feed this child
on a weed-puller's wages?"
3335,"You missed one! Over there!
No, not your <Emphasis>there</Emphasis>,
my <Emphasis>there</Emphasis>!"
3336,"Y-Yes, milord!"
3337,"I knows me a watched pot
ne'er boils, but Ma said
aught 'bout watched grapes!"
3338,"A city full to burstin' with
gobbie lifts and pulleys,
yet still we has all these
bloody swivin' stairs."
3339,"You see that, uplander?
I built that! Uh...with a
little hand-lending, of course."
3340,"Welcome to the Hard Place!
Pull up a rock! Hah hah hah!"
3341,"Hoo! Hah!
Hoo hoo hah!"
3342,"<click> <click>
My limbs...they will not stop moving."
3343,"Won't you dance with me, kupo?"
3344,What!? I only struck 'im once!
3345,"Alright, I may have taken a
tumble or three with her
Ned...but that don't give
her the right to steal my cow!"
3346,"Hmph. If he only knew his
son's <Emphasis>true</Emphasis> sire. "
3347,"Where have you two been?
Father's fever has grown
worse and we need those
popotoes for his stew."
3348,"Forgive us, Mother...
There are no popotoes..."
3349,"We used the last of the
coin on...on...honey cakes..."
3350,"On honey cakes!?
ON HONEY CAKES!?"
3351,"If the fever takes your
father, those cakes might
be the last thing you
ever eat!"
3352,"I'll have to sell the both
of you to the goblins!"
3353,"No, Mother!"
3354,Anything but that!
3355,"Then you'd best hope that
the refuse pile behind the
inn turns up something good.
Come on now!"
3356,"Will someone tell me
why we are here again?"
3357,"Why? Just a friendly race,
of course. You lads run,
we girls take care of the
rest."
3358,"Well then, what are we
waitin' for? I'm gonna
sprint circles around
rabbit-ears, here!"
3359,"Lookin' for some action,
milord? I'll give you ten to
one on the Hyur."
3360,"Lookin' for some action,
milady? I'll give you ten to
one on the Hyur."
3361,Ten to...what?
3362,"Ahem!
Run like you mean it,
boys. I've a moon's
allowance riding on this."
3363,Ready...GO!
3364,"Hah hah hah! I'm the
fastest in all Dravania!"
3365,"I shouldn't have sold
my breakfast to that goblin."
3366,I was born to run!
3367,I need...to...catch my...breath...
3368,"You cheated!
I want a rematch!"
3369,"<Emphasis>I</Emphasis> cheated?
<Emphasis>You</Emphasis> cheated!"
3370,"The sun's going down.
I'm going to need a bit
more light to count my
winnings."
3371,"Rain? Let's take this
inside, boys."
3372,I'll race you to the inn!
3373,This mountain did not fight...as a gentleman...
3374,"Oh, Inspector! Are you hurt!? Maybe you should hibernate a bit longer."
3375,I shall see that someone pays for this! Why is my name not on here!?
3376,"Watch well, Honoroit—you may learn a thing or two!"
3377,"My lord, please stop this before you hurt yourself!"
3378,One good ticket—that's all I need!
3379,Get ready for a Raubahn roasting!
3380,I'll have ye know the Admiral's no slouch!
3381,I cannot help but feel at a disadvantage here...
3382,"Not even a nibble...
Just one more cast!"
3383,Ready whenever you are!
3384,"Twenty years since the
mad king's attack and yet
it is still so beautiful."
3385,"I have never seen the statue
from so close before!"
3386,The building ahead is the Closed Fist!
3387,"Only Disciples of War or Magic
may venture inside."
3388,Fire everything!
3389,Destroy the artillery!
3390,For the Empire!
3391,"Was that... No, just my eyes playing tricks..."
3392,We mustn't let them escape...
3393,Where could they have gone?
3394,They're close...
3395,Are you alright?
3396,That wound looks deep...
3397,"Quickly!
Captain Wolf needs you!"
3398,Hrah!
3399,Grah!
3400,I'll show you!
3401,Heh heh...
3402,Enough!
3403,That stings!
3404,Just look at it!
3405,It's so scaly...
3406,Did it just speak!?
3407,No telling what awaits. Stay sharp.
3408,"So, er, where do we go exactly?"
3409,Would help if there were a path.
3410,"Hm, I think this floor moves."
3411,Let's all gather at the center.
3412,Aha!
3413,Let the fun begin.
3414,Is that one of those monitors?
3415,Shall we show our strength to it?
3416,It's different to the ones earlier.
3417,"What's this cube, now?"
3418,I suspect we're about to find out.
3419,"Now, <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> is my kind of battle!"
3420,Hold on! I'm working on it!
3421,Some kind of teleporter?
3422,Looks like we're going through.
3423,I'll give it a try!
3424,I'll not fall that easily!
3425,"Were you going to bet, or
just stare at that two till
it magically becomes an ace?"
3426,"Pipe down. Makin' yer
sorry arse sweat is
all part o' me strategy."
3427,The imperials are everywhere...
3428,Reinforcements?
3429,I'm fine! See to the others!
3430,It can't end here...
3431,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
3432,"Confound it, wherever are they hiding?"
3433,They are close. I can sense it...
3434,"Was that─? Oh, that's just a tree..."
3435,"H-Hey, wait!"
3436,"Heh, someone's eager. Come on, let's follow."
3437,Foolish...fool...
3438,Not the pom...
3439,I'm too young to kupo...
3440,It is just as I thought.
3441,Our worst fears are confirmed...
3442,That leaves three...
3443,Back to the ship!
3444,The cargo is secure?
3445,"Hehe, I wonder what awaits."
3446,"Uh, there's more this time."
3447,Yet another model.
3448,"Steady does it, Wedge..."
3449,"Look, another teleporter!"
3450,And on we go...
3451,Not like this...
3452,Mercy!
3453,Moving along like clockwork!
3454,You know no hesitation.
3455,"Well, of course. We're mortal."
3456,We may need to strengthen the undercarriage...
3457,These bearings are not good enough.
3458,"Who goes there!?
Show yourselves!"
3459,What was that...?
3460,That structure ahead must be the Deltascape.
3461,And there're two monitors in the way...
3462,Kill <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>!
3463,Bah! Bloody waste o' coin!
3464,The hells you doin'!?
3465,Hack <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> to pieces!
3466,Godsdammit!
3467,"Hurry up and make
<If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> dead already!"
3468,Please accept this gift as thanks for your services.
3469,What has happened here!?
3470,Looters!?
3471,"Man-flesh is ours!
Man-flesh is ours!"
3472,Go and loot your own loots!
3473,"Eat your flesh too
for this trespass!"
3474,"You don't want...
to go back there."
3475,This'll make a fine hull.
3476,"No room.
Move along."
3477,"My pot.
Here first."
3478,"AAAHHH!!!
Don't scare me like that!"
3479,Nothing to see here.
3480,"Fortune smiles on
the wise shopper!"
3481,"But <Emphasis>of course</Emphasis> all you
see here is authentic!"
3482,"He was a damned pirate,
I tell you. He had an
eyepatch!"
3483,"Where did you find that
amazing earthenware?
Might you be interested
in selling?"
3484,"If I could only recall
what I was searching for..."
3485,"The Sekiseigumi bastards
will be the death of us!"
3486,"It feels like I'm wearing
<Emphasis>nothing at all</Emphasis>."
3487,"Lower...
Lower...
Loooweeer..."
3488,"My, what broad
shoulders you have."
3489,"Would you like
to join us?"
3490,"Go on! You can have
the first punch!"
3491,"No, <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> can have the
first punch!"
3492,"Would someone just
punch someone already?"
3493,Strength!
3494,Honor!
3495,Blood!
3496,"Back the way ye came,
filthy ijin."
3497,"Sandals! Get your sandals!
Guaranteed to last or your
next pair is free!"
3498,"Father will kill you if he
finds out you took his
drawings of the pretty maids."
3499,"The tea here is sublime.
Not like the swill they
serve at that teahouse
across town."
3500,"You must clear your
mind and become one
with the blade."
3501,Not now. Eating dango.
3502,I believe I could fly...
3503,I'm drunk!? YOU'RE drunk!
3504,"...And then she stormed
out saying she was joining
the Sekiseigumi!"
3505,"Rhalgr take yer sticks!
Me hands'll do me fine."
3506,"These 'ere sticks make
fer good shovels, like."
3507,"That was the most
amazing play I've seen!
...Well, this week at least."
3508,"I will need to see what
is in this crate and these
barrels before <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>sunrise<Else/>midday</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>sundown<Else/>sunrise</If></If>."
3509,"A thousand apologies.
Your skiff will be here
at any moment."
3510,Sound the alarm!
3511,You will not escape us!
3512,"Make yourselves at
home, honored travelers."
3513,"Come on. It's my turn
to play with the stick."
3514,"Come inside, traveler!
We've dancers of all
shapes and sizes!"
3515,"What is this I hear of you
bathing with the locals!?"
3516,"(I hear they keep her
in the castle dungeons...)"
3517,"My good-for-nothing
husband spends morning
and night under Sanjo's
red lamps, the lech!"
3518,"'Tis good to see a
fellow Eorzean."
3519,"If the piermaster thinks
I'm to work another
twenty-bell shift, he's as
daft as he looks!"
3520,"Eight lengths.
Just as you asked, sir."
3521,"Fancy a dip down at
the springs?"
3522,"Clean enough to
eat off, men!"
3523,"Carry all this!?
Who's going to carry <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>!?"
3524,"Was right kind of them
to leave all this wine in
their cargo! Gahahaha!"
3525,"Think we should add
another to his cart? Hahaha!"
3526,"Hurry! Before the
steel cools!"
3527,"A blade can never
be <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> sharp, now."
3528,Ten gil says there're more cubes too.
3529,Stay focused! We're almost there!
3530,Yaaargh! Moment of truth!
3531,"I won't break first...
I won't break first..."
3532,"What kind of name is that
anyway? Eastern highland?"
3533,"Make a fine rug, that one."
3534,"What are we supposed
to be aiming at again?"
3535,"There!
No... Just a rabbit...
There! Over there!
No... Just a badger..."
3536,"Treat a cannon like you'd
treat a woman and if you're
lucky, she won't blow your
face off. The cannon, that is."
3537,"If you people knew how
hard it was to balance
on these tails all day..."
3538,"Curssses! Sssomeone's
been using my bow!"
3539,Your tailwork is pathetic!
3540,"Not a single rat in,
not a single rat out."
3541,"I suppose I could go back
to work... I also suppose I
could slay young Zenos in
a duel."
3542,"Now where in the seven
hells did he go?"
3543,Get lost! They'll find me!
3544,"A bucketful of naught,
this here is."
3545,"There's more rock here
than soil. It's a miracle
anything grows at all."
3546,"If the blight takes these,
we won't last through
the winter."
3547,"Pass me that arak, friend!
My bottle is mysteriously
empty. Hah hah hah!"
3548,"Wait...
But that would mean─"
3549,"Must keep the barrels
free of soot, or it'll be
our heads flying come war."
3550,"Thanking them? They
should be thanking us
for protecting their
backwood arses!"
3551,"Biggest crystal east of
the Velodyna, you say?
I've seen bigger."
3552,"Iffin I find either o' yous
dockin' the dells o' any
o' these here maids, I'll
cut ye neck to crotch."
3553,"A fine spear, she is.
I cannot rightly say I've
e'er seen finer."
3554,"Papin, darling. Would you
mind fetching your ma
a skin of water?"
3555,"They say the Bull tilled
this very soil by dragging
a ten-tonze boulder he
broke from Mount Yorn."
3556,"You have one mission
and one mission only─
to make it back here alive!"
3557,"The mounts are
watered and fed?"
3558,"Sharpened this so many
times it'll cut you if you
even look at the blade!"
3559,"Sure, spinning th' fork over
me head leaves th' belly
exposed... But it looks epic!"
3560,"Naught like the twang of
catgut in the morning...
or evening, for that matter."
3561,"Saw an imperial run back
this way, I did. You going
to gut 'im, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>milady<Else/>milord</If>?"
3562,But are we <Emphasis>truly</Emphasis> free?
3563,"Liberrraded ale's the
bestesest of ales... <hic>"
3564,"I's thinkin' of joining
a mummer's troupe."
3565,"Are we but cattle
to be led to slaughter!?"
3566,"Yeah!
...I mean, no!"
3567,"All men should be
allowed a single vice."
3568,"Wouldn't want me to
mess up that pretty face
now, would you?"
3569,"Whydo I e'en bother
drinkin' it if I's juss goina
leaveitall 'ere onna street?"
3570,"This has been
a long time coming."
3571,"We'll need to make an
incision here...and here."
3572,"I've thinned this tonic so
many times, an ale would
work better to numb the
patients' aches."
3573,"Here's to hopin' he's
in a better place..."
3574,"The moment you let your
guard down is the moment
you die. Do I make myself
clear!?"
3575,"This statue's as
hard as a rock!"
3576,"Come on, Biggs, you can do this..."
3577,"Now, where are those mummers off hiding?"
3578,"Rice, miso, sake,
revolvers, silk...wait,
revolvers?"
3579,"The smell of sulphur is
strong on the wind, today."
3580,"I never grow tired of
watchin' the Lid. The
stench, now, is another
matter."
3581,"Naught amiss at
the Price...yet."
3582,"It's right under us.
I can <Emphasis>feel</Emphasis> it!"
3583,"This land has been lawfully
claimed by the Empire.
Begone or you will be...
dealt with."
3584,You...
3585,"Do not take another step
further into the village!
You have been warned!"
3586,"These will fetch quite
the price at market."
3587,"Hic...! How manyfinners am
I hollin'up? Wait! Dontellme...
Free─hic─no four! Seven!"
3588,"You need some help?
There's <Emphasis>one</Emphasis> box, and
<Emphasis>two</Emphasis> casks. Now can
we go?"
3589,"You! You've got to save
us. This man... He's not
right in the head! Please!"
3590,"Only way through them
doors is iffin I's carryin'
yer nob in a sack."
3591,"Da makes the best rice
balls in the village, and
I'll plug the gob of any
who'll say he don't!"
3592,"Sprung a damned leak
when I took her o'er the
shoals near Sakazuki."
3593,Most beautiful... Yes...
3594,"Your wisdom is as
bounteous as the sea."
3595,"Whose shell is it again
that I've been polishing
all day?"
3596,"Open your minds...
Open your minds...
Open your minds..."
3597,"Do you think she's noticed
me standing here for the
past twelve bells?"
3598,"A place for every gig
and every gig in its place."
3599,"Water, water, everywhere
and all you do is drink!"
3600,"My brothers aren't
going to like this..."
3601,"I'm so hungry, I could
eat a horse."
3602,"Oh, and look.
They have some here..."
3603,"A nice, ripe squash would
go well with that horse..."
3604,"Never been that
fond of rice..."
3605,"And these fish reek
of my tribe's latrine..."
3606,"Though, enough pepper
in the pot, I could boil
my boot and I reckon it'd
taste fine enough."
3607,"Like to buy some milk?
Probably good and sour
by now!"
3608,"You look like you could
use a basket. Or perhaps
you know someone who
could use a basket?"
3609,.........
3610,Baaaaaa!
3611,.........
3612,.........?
3613,"You'll find none more
skilled with a morin khuur."
3614,"I'm to herd four score
rutting rams with <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>?"
3615,"Thirsty lambs... Leave
some for the tribe, now."
3616,Right between the legs!
3617,"Lose this fight and your
place at the fire is lost!"
3618,Closer... Closer!
3619,"Too taut...
Much too taut."
3620,"Come on! One more round!
Best twenty-eight out of
fifty-five!"
3621,"What am I even doing with
this thing? I wanted to
learn the spear..."
3622,"Children of the dawn
let long your horns hang...♪"
3623,"On the east wind rides
the whisper of the land.♪"
3624,"Ten thousand three hun-
dred and sixty-eight.
Ten thousand three hun-
dred and sixty-nine."
3625,I am the wind. I am the sky.
3626,Let us meditate on this.
3627,"Why must we learn letters
if it is our destiny to fight?"
3628,"Oh, quiet, you!"
3629,Have at me!
3630,A finer spear I have not seen.
3631,"Baa, baa, baa!"
3632,Baa.
3633,We must prepare for every contingency!
3634,Those Bertha cannons of yours are bloody fast!
3635,"The Maelstrom's cannons are no less impressive, from what I have seen..."
3636,"This is it, lads!"
3637,"Can ye hear us, Zenos!?
Eorzea is at yer gates!"
3638,"I don't see where you are
going with this, Haname."
3639,"So we're just going
to sit and wait until
the enemy attacks!?"
3640,"All we do is train!
When do we fight!?"
3641,"Wrong! Float like a butter-
fly, sting like a <Emphasis>bee</Emphasis>, not
the other way around!"
3642,Better! Better!
3643,And nothing over here.
3644,"Pretend like she's not
watching me... Pretend
like she's not watching me."
3645,"My grandmother would say,
“A crooked back makes
for straighter stalks.”"
3646,"Not a beast to be found...
Well, except for those
over there... And there..."
3647,"I have to keep the square
clean for when my grand-
son returns from the war."
3648,"One, one, two.
One, one, two."
3649,So what happens now?
3650,"We can fight, godsdammit!"
3651,Imperial whoresons!
3652,We must be ready to move at a moment's notice.
3653,Are we not men? Do we not bleed? Do we not deserve to be free!?
3654,The plan is set...
3655,Won't be long now.
3656,If the fighting spreads here...
3657,Trust in your comrades! Have faith in yourselves and mighty Rhalgr! Victory will be ours!
3658,"Sir, yes, sir!"
3659,"Sir, yes, sir!"
3660,"Sir, yes, sir!"
3661,"Nice work, Tchakha!"
3662,The fruit of my efforts!
3663,"Can they really be
the Fist of Rhalgr?"
3664,"That technique...
It couldn't be!"
3665,"How tough are these
pugilists, you reckon?"
3666,"I'm keener to see how
tough the monks are."
3667,"Oh, shite, the monks
ain't doing too good."
3668,"So much for the new Fist.
'Twas nothing but talk."
3669,"...And flex and shake
and bounce and..."
3670,Bloody nerves...
3671,"Aye, that'll cut 'em to the bone..."
3672,Did you see the way they ran!?
3673,If only it were always this easy...
3674,Seven hells! I daresay you single-handedly won us this bridge!
3675,"We're alive, we're all alive..."
3676,"Ye gods, woman! Don't tell me this was your first..."
3677,The slop ready?
3678,Hm... Could use some salt.
3679,As it'll ever be.
3680,"Why don't you go tell
the men it's ready?"
3681,"The stew's a bit bland.
Did you forget the salt?"
3682,"My apologies. We used
the last this morning."
3683,"I need one of you to
give me a hand."
3684,"I just thought... Bah,
forget I asked."
3685,"“Give me a hand.” Hah!
How about giving us a hand?"
3686,"Does it look like we've one
to give?"
3687,"Ugh... Wh-Who are
these bastards?"
3688," <pant> We...we had
no answer to them..."
3689,"Keep back! Any closer
and the sickness will
spread!"
3690,Why. Won't. This. Break!?
3691,"What I wouldn't give for a
nice bloody haunch of..."
3692,Your son... I'm sorry...
3693,Aye... No better yonder...
3694,May the elementals show us favor in our hour of need...
3695,"Matron guide my arrows, that each might strike true..."
3696,Heh heh... The Ala Mhigan Brigade is coming for you lot...
3697,"O Thal, should I fall this day, may You grant me peace everlasting..."
3698,Victory will be ours!
3699,"Time to split skulls
the Lominsan way!"
3700,No turning back!
3701,"Da says this is the
last of the rice."
3702,"What do you think
is wrong with him?"
3703,"There's barely enough
there for three more nights."
3704,How did you get up─ Oh.

3711,I can't wait to see the fireworks!
3712,Wow! It's beautiful!
3713,Spectacular!
3714,They certainly made a show of it this year!
3715,This is going to be a Moonfire to remember!
3716,Long live the Moonfire Faire!
3717,I feel as though...I'm being watched.
3718,Now that muscular body is bound to bear some sin.
3719,I love you! Tell me you love me!
3720,"I... I'm sorry. It's not me, it's you. I think we should see other people."
3721,Searching for treasure in this heat sure is tiring.
3722,Have the fireworks started yet?
3723,Waiting at the beach isn't as easy as it sounds.
3724,I can barely contain myself!
3725,I don't know which is more beautiful─these muscles or these fireworks.
3726,You're far more beautiful than any fireworks display.
3727,"Oh, stop it."
3728,You're far more beautiful than any f─ N-Never mind.
3729,Just look at that ocean!
3730,I've never had so much fun in my life!
3731,Hehehe. I'm holding back on the freshly baked goods.
3732,I never knew bears could be so adorable!
3733,But what if they get loose and go on a murderous rampage!?
3734,Have you seen the bears' new trick yet?
3735,"Nothing to report...to you.
And who are you again?"
3736,"I've seen my share of
forbidden lands, but this
here is by far the worst."
3737,"Unaspected, deaspected,
over-aspected, corrupted,
luminous, demi-, and now
protean? When will it end!?"
3738,"Always. <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>Tonight<Else/>Today</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>Today<Else/>Tonight</If></If>'s prey?"
3739,"I would feast on the
succulent flesh of fish."
3740,<gasp>
3741,"Loch Seld's salt'll be
the talk of the realm!"
3742,"The second floor's lost,
but the cellar seems solid..."
3743,"Right, let's get the
equipment cleaned up
and in working order!"
3744,"Do I fight, or...?"
3745,Never in all my days...
3746,Damn the Qalyana!
3747,Of all the places to die...
3748,"Baut...
Save me..."
3749,I'll not fall here!
3750,"Bah, this spear
will have to do!"
3751,What in the hells!?
3752,"I came in peace!
I leave in pieces!?"
3753,...
3754,"We must protect
the envoys!"
3755,Accept your fate!
3756,"It's Her!
The Goddess Herself!"
3757,"That was a right mess, eh?"
3758,"Saved by the Butcher.
The bloody Butcher..."
3759,They disssgrace all Ananta...
3760,"My thanks.
I'd thought myself done for."
3761,"I was ill prepared
for such a meeting..."
3762,Have you a moment?
3763,"Always, my friend."
3764,"I'm to search for relics
today. Might you have a
request?"
3765,"You know my tastes─
the older, the better."
3766,"You're back...and so soon.
Did fortune bless you?"
3767,"She did, my friend! She did!"
3768,This is positively ancient!
3769,Now where to put it...
3770,"Ever occupied, these ones."
3771,Just as brilliant as yesterday.
3772,"Oh great kami, can you
hear me, your humble admirer?"
3773,"This piece is so polished,
I can see the future in it!"
3774,Here's a list for next time.
3775,"Do you think our friends in
Namai will come again?"
3776,I'm the lord of all Doma!
3777,"Hien...
I've found you at last..."
3778,"Ugh, my aching neck..."
3779,Ready for your next task?
3780,Hnnngh!
3781,"Lady Yugiri!
Show us that move again!"
3782,"What a mess.
We'll need more workers..."
3783,Fifteen...sixteen...
3784,"Help!
I can't hold on!"
3785,"I sweep and I sweep...
Still dirt."
3786,Another crate here for you.
3787,"Right. Put it down
with the others."
3788,All clear on the docks!
3789,"Master Tsuranuki says
he isn't hungry."
3790,"He needs to eat.
I'll take a bowl over myself."
3791,"Now, where did...
Ugh, I've looked everywhere!"
3792,"I'll get to it, then."
3793,"That smells wonderful!
What's in it?"
3794,"Just tofu and vegetables!
And maybe a secret spice
or two."
3795,I've brought you a poultice!
3796,"I told you...
...to leave me be..."
3797,Do you have enough miso?
3798,"I'll check.
Just a moment!"
3799,"Miso...miso...
Which jar was it again...?"
3800,"Please hurry.
I can feel my
fingers slipping..."
3801,Kill them! Kill them all!
3802,"These salt fleas will
suck the poor girl dry!"
3803,"I sssee...
I shall have some more delivered."
3804,"A swarm of tracer antlions
is approaching from the north!"
3805,"Then you'd better
round up some men
and take care of it!"
3806,"We are eager
to prove ourssselves."
3807,"Perhaps we should
ask for something less
dangerous this time?"
3808,"Surely you don't need
those cast-off skins?
Name your price!"
3809,Are you in need of provisions?
3810,"We've got enough food,
but we're running low on arak!"
3811,Understood!
3812,"A marid eats as much
in a day as five chocobos
do in a sennight."
3813,"They say the best salt's
that what's been harvested
by hand...er, rake."
3814,"They seem to be doing
just fine without my help."
3815,"You see anything, you
either kill it or you run─
just not in this direction."
3816,"I can put an arrow in the
eye of a yabby from a
hundred paces...give or
take ninety-five."
3817,"If I find you've been cutting
Master Lolorito's salt with
chalk again..."
3818,Never! You have my word!
3819,"There's plenty of salt to
sell...but no one to buy it."
3820,"These blocks are not
going to move themselves."
3821,"You've two, don't you?"
3822,I could use another hand.
3823,"If it helps Ala Mhigo,
I'll rake from dawn till dusk!"
3824,"They say there is none
finer than Saltery salt,
and the Bismarck must
have the finest!"
3825,"Thank Nophica for pack
chocobos. I don't fancy
carrying a sack of salt all
the way back to Gridania..."
3826,"Mmm...
I don't know which
to sample first!"
3827,"You can't leave without
a souvenir!"
3828,"So, <Emphasis>everything</Emphasis> is salted...?"
3829,"Aye, your father'd be proud..."
3830,It's all so busy now!
3831,"Salted fish! Salted treats!
Go on, have a taste!"
3832,"Our quality is second to none!
And production has increased tenfold!"
3833,"Now that the factory's up and
working, it's a matter of
expanding operations..."
3834,"I'm sure we can find
work for them all..."
3835,"Now we've more hands than
we know what to do with!"
3836,"We didn't see nothing if
you didn't see nothing."
3837,"But we have done nothing
wrong! Nothing!"
3838,You're looking better today!
3839,"No thanks to you and
your nosiness."
3840,"Ishibushi! Help! I know you
can hear me! Ishibushi!"
3841,"I can take over, if you like..."
3842,"Aye, aye, that's the way..."
3843,Area past the gate's not safe.
3844,"It's not a bad idea, but..."
3845,"Must you be forever ringing...
that infernal bell..."
3846,"So I says to the maiko, I says..."
3847,"Way's closed. We're still
clearing plots."
3848,Rice...is happiness...
3849,"I could do this all <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>night<Else/>day</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>day<Else/>night</If></If>!"
3850,Ma's calling for you!
3851,Not now! I'm busy!
3852,"Da says he's gonna throw all
your toys in the One River if
you don't come right now!"
3853,I'm not falling for that again!
3854,Fine! See what happens!
3855,Leave the materials here?
3856,"Aye, right there's fine!"
3857,"I can't wait to see what it
looks like when it's finished!"
3858,"Wonder what they're
going to do with it..."
3859,Where do you want these?
3860,Give me a moment!
3861,"Where did I leave
that ledger...?"
3862,"(Don't...don't mind
me over here... Ugh...)"
3863,"Then what would you like
us to purchase instead?"
3864,That ought to suffice for now.
3865,"Looks like we've still
got plenty of spices."
3866,"Very good, very good..."
3867,"Hmm... Thought we had more
around here somewhere..."
3868,"I don't think we've got enough
vegetables to last the week."
3869,"Let Kozakura know.
She'll take care of it."
3870,"Everything is accounted for.
I triple-checked."
3871,"Including the materials
for Master Tsuranuki?"
3872,...Perhaps I should check again.
3873,Perhaps you should.
3874,I come bearing gifts!
3875,Any luck?
3876,I've got a good feeling...
3877,Something took the bait!
3878,Oho!
3879,A marvelous catch!
3880,Let's see what else is biting!
3881,Reeled it in too quickly...?
3882,Don't give up so easily!
3883,...Is this upside down?
3884,Need anything?
3885,"Might could do with
a few more boards!"
3886,I'll see what I can do.
3887,Smiths need more boards─
3888,It's time to go!
3889,Can't we stay another night?
3890,"No! We didn't come
all the way here to
laze about!"
3891,"But we might never
be able to sleep on
such comfy beds again!"
3892,"I'll blame you if
someone else claims those
marks before we do!"
3893,"One more night!
That's all I ask!"
3894,Kweh!
3895,"We're spreading
ourselves too thin..."
3896,"Tell me, does this hurt?"
3897,"Ah! Only when you
poke it like that!"
3898,"That means you're
on the mend."
3899,"Be more careful in future.
You're no good to us dead."
3900,Argh! My stomach!
3901,"You shouldn't eat
wild berries. They
could be poisonous!"
3902,"Do it again, and I'll
cut you open and
dig them out myself!"
3903,"I could while away the hours,
Liftin' bags of salt and flour,
If I only had a crane.♪"
3904,"Winching her up, then!
Stand clear!"
3905,The buckets are full!
3906,"A manfool!
A manfool in our midst!"
3907,I hate manfools!
3908,The manfool is still about...
3909,Gah! What a stalker!
3910,"Haven't seen you around
before. You new?"
3911,"Sure am! Just went 
through the change!"
3912,"Heh, pretty rare for a rat
to live long enough─"
3913,"Rat? Rat!?
I am an otter, good sir!"
3914,"That's it! I'm going to
go and see the sacred
crystal right this instant!"
3915,"Don't do it! Genbu's gonna
put a curse on you!"
3916,Hah! You can't scare me!
3917,None shall pass!
3918,Just this once! Please!
3919,"Set one hoof inside and
Genbu will curse you for
ten thousand years!"
3920,"Fine! But you haven't
heard the last of this!"
3921,They wouldn't let me pass...
3922,"Of course not!
They didn't before,
so why would they now!?"
3923,"It's been a while since
I said hello..."
3924,"I am of a mind to hunt.
Interested?"
3925,"Such serenity, such peace..."
3926,Though my body aches...
3927,"I no longer fear for my soul.
My thanks to you..."
3928,"Hehe, you're funny!"
3929,Do you have any more medicine?
3930,"It's getting harder to come by.
You'll have to pay double."
3931,"Didn't think you'd come back,
given your condition..."
3932,"...Was curious, is all."
3933,Never hurts to have an extra set of eyes looking over the hull!
3934,"Need to get this
tub patched up..."
3935,"Look at you, boy.
Life on the sea has
made you strong..."
3936,"Mother, I...
I never thought
I'd see you again."
3937,"We hardly dared hope!
Thank the kami you're alive..."
3938,"Who's your friend?
A new auspice?"
3939,Meow!♪
3940,"Oh him? He's just some
cat that wandered in."
3941,"Wandered in? Past the
wards and guards and
<Emphasis>liquid hot magma</Emphasis>!?"
3942,
3943,
3944,"Is it appropriate to
grab him like that?"
3945,"As long as it's above
the belt... I think..."
3946,"Is that it?
I can still carry more."
3947,I could use a dozen more like you...
3948,"That's it, my friends.
Now lift your knees higher."
3949,"You did it!
You slew the meownster!"
3950,"Don't forget to carve
a scale or two off his hide."
3951,"Tell me more of how you
fractured that man's skull!"
3952,"Time for a break? Yes, yes?"
3953,"No Namazu may wield a
bow without supervision."
3954,"I almost made it up
onto the horse today!"
3955,"Mmm, fish... Yes, yes..."
3956,Fins off the offering!
3957,I-I was just looking!
3958,"Are you sure? Your
eyes say you are lying..."
3959,"They do not! No, no."
3960,"Eat the offering <Emphasis>one time</Emphasis>
and never hear the end of it..."
3961,"Are you in need of
a target or three?"
3962,My fins hurt...
3963,"What a coincidence!
My fins hurt too!"
3964,"Amazing! Mine
hurt more, though."
3965,Will you please come down?
3966,I c-cannot just now...
3967,Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
3968,"No, no. Over here!"
3969,"Over here! Yes, yes."
3970,Whatever is the matter?
3971,My happi is missing!
3972,"I know we have
extras somewhere..."
3973,"Wait, are you not wearing it?"
3974,Wow! So I am!
3975,Steady yourself!
3976,Anything broken?
3977,<puff> <puff>
3978,One more...for the road!
3979,"Bit bland, isn't it..."
3980,Maybe a dash of miso...
3981,Be careful with that miso!
3982,What will you be selling?
3983,You'll see!
3984,"Good, good..."
3985,This ought to suffice...
3986,"Gosh, that smells good!"
3987,"And what kind of stall
are you hoping for?"
3988,A salmon stall!
3989,Err... Just salmon?
3990,I suppose...that might...
3991,They look so real...
3992,I wanna try one!
3993,But I haven't got much─
3994,"One of each, please!"
3995,What!? Absolutely not!
3996,"...All right, one. One!"
3997,Hehe... So many choices...
3998,"All laid out, like you asked."
3999,Oh? Where's the eggplant?
4000,"None today, I'm afraid..."
4001,Could use more dzo meat!
4002,I'll pass it along!
4003,"Catch of the day!
Fresh from the Ruby Sea!"
4004,"Bah, I can't decide..."
4005,Hands where I can see...
4006,Show us what you've got!
4007,"I'm not afraid...
But it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> awfully high, isn't it?"
4008,Stop making excuses and go!
4009,It's a long way down...
4010,<pant> It's a miracle I survived...
4011,So this is where it starts getting tricky?
4012,"Pirates lose to ninjas?
Over my dead body!"
4013,I can't do it... I can't do it!
4014,It all hangs on this final stage...
4015,"How could I shame myself so
in front of my beloved?"
4016,If only I were a ninja!
4017,I knew you'd reach the top!
4018,"I wasn't watching.
Could you do that again for me?"
4019,"Of all the ones to complete the course,
you're my favorite!"
4020,"Come one, come all!
The Moonfire Faire is here!"
4021,"Adventurers! Test your
skills on the Eorzean
Nimble Warrior course!"
4022,"Come on, let's go for a swim!"
4023,Shall we go and watch?
4024,"It's certainly impressive,
but it's a bit of an eyesore..."
4025,I wonder what Master Gegeruju is like?
4026,There's always time for squats!
4027,"In the way?
No, not at all!"
4028,"Finish the course?
We're too busy looking good!"
4029,Mustn't...let go...
4030,Argh! Stop shaking it!
4031,And this is the easy part!?
4032,Am I truly ready?
4033,"I know you're not supposed to fall off, but it <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> quite fun!"
4034,"I'm not drowning,
I'm just resting."
4035,"I mustn't give in to
my fear next time...
I must focus."
4036,"<splutter> Gods!
Am I dead!?"
4037,Is that all you've got!?
4038,That's the way! Just a little farther!
4039,You're almost there!
4040,Let me know when someone promising shows up.
4041,I had a feeling that Lalafell chap would struggle...
4042,I could watch this all day!
4043,"And I need a long, hot bath!
We've all got to wait our turn!"
4044,This is no small order...
4045,"But are they absolutely,
<Emphasis>perfectly</Emphasis> parallel...?"
4046,Will these do?
4047,Give me a moment!
4048,"Shipment ought to be
arriving soon, I think..."
4049,"About time! This saw's got
no teeth left to speak of..."
4050,"Hey, about those tools─"
4051,"Not today, I'm afraid.
Delivery's been delayed.
Again..."
4052,...Heard that?
4053,"Aye. Should've known.
We'll make do as always..."
4054,The lighter the better...
4055,Aren't we spoiled for choice...
4056,Pine it is!
4057,"...And then the handle split
right down the middle!"
4058,"Surely there's got to be
something I can do..."
4059,...Or not. Back to my bunk.
4060,Really can't be bothered...
4061,A little more and it'll be finished! You'll see!
4062,Impressive craftsmanship...
4063,"Just watching everyone work
makes me feel...I don't know..."
4064,...Like we've turned a corner?
4065,"Excellent work! This should be
more than enough!"
4066,We'll need to add ash soon...
4067,"Arms holding up? Even
though it's been a while?"
4068,I could do this all day!
4069,Looking good...
4070,Hurrrgh!
4071,"By the kami, I'm spent!"
4072,"No, this isn't the place."
4073,...Just tell me where to take it.
4074,"What did the Shazenkai
fellow say again?"
4075,I wonder where he went...
4076,"Really, it's far too much for
the elders to handle..."
4077,"...Actually, I, uh, I don't
really like heights..."
4078,"Anyone here caught cheating
answers to <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>, understand?"
4079,Next time. Next time I'll hit the cactpot.
4080,"A present? But it's not
even my nameday!"
4081,"Hells take your cards!
I say we race chocobos!"
4082,We should play Triple Triad!
4083,"Don't stray too far,
got that? I promised to
keep an eye on you."
4084,I <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> have that bunny suit!
4085,'Tis your mind playing tricks on you. Nothing more.
4086,I swear I've seen him somewhere before...
4087,"You ladies head up first.
I'll take the rear..."
4088,"You'll take my pickaxe to the
eye should you try anything."
4089,Don't be such a ssspoilsport.
4090,"Such magnificent muscles.
Heh heh heh..."
4091,"When the children are happy,
Zhloe's happy too!"
4092,"I love festivals, don't you, T'kebbe?"
4093,"This is so much fun!
Thank you, Miss Zhloe!"
4094,Some of the wood is missing...

4096,"Well enough, well enough."
4097,"Working hard, or hardly working?"
4098,Having the time of my life!
4099,"Hah! Well, try not to overdo it."
4100,Like...like this?
4101,Shall I set it down by the reclamation box?
4102,"Aye, if it's no trouble!"
4103,Not at all.
4104,More for the pile!
4105,"Ah, where to put it..."
4106,Don't rush on my account.
4107,Where could he be...?
4108,Medicine... I need more...
4109,"Sorry, friend, but I'm
short this one herb..."
4110,"If I had it, I could sort you out."
4111,...Tell me where it grows.
4112,Hnnngh...
4113,Graaaghhh...
4114,Grrrrrr...

freezes in the bloody bottle?"
4117,（★未使用／削除予定★）
4118,（★未使用／削除予定★）
4119,"Ahh, feel that heat!"
4120,"Gerolt's definitely got a knack
for more than weapons."
4121,Think it's worth digging out?
4122,"Depends on who's got to
do the digging."
4123,"Wonder if it'll cook faster
if we keep staring."
4124,"Eh, not like I've got
anywhere else to be..."
4125,"A place for everything and
everything in its place..."
4126,"Even a shallow well
shouldn't freeze like this!"
4127,Thisss place is a maze!
4128,Kageyama must not escape us.
4129,If I have calculated the rice-per-fulm ratio correctly...
4130,This is awfully thirsty work!
4131,I have come to harvest your souls! Errr...I mean rice.
4132,Picking up all these stones is not my idea of fun.
4133,"So, how does it look?"
4134,"Full of weeds and stones, I'm afraid."
4135,"“Many hands make light work,” they say."
4136,I spy some more weeds that want pulling up.
4137,"It may not be lifelike, but it keeps the crows away!"
4138,Oh...I knew I should've labeled these boxes.
4139,Hold still so I can get this mud out of your fur!
4140,"In the morning, laughing happy fish heads.♪
In the evening, floating in the soup!♪"
4141,"And now for my secret ingredient... Once I find it, anyway."
4142,I'm telling you! We should be making sake!
4143,The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.
4144,I suppose I will have to climb down at some point.
4145,What should we use for the roof?
4146,Zelkova should do the trick.
4147,Leave it to me!
4148,Ummm... Which ones are zelkova?
4149,Carry the timber up the ladder? Easier said than done!
4150,Just like carrying a wife over the threshold. But with timber.
4151,What do you have in mind?
4152,Should be ready in a few bells...
4153,"What's this? <Emphasis>When in Doma, Do as the Domans Do: A Guide for Ijin</Emphasis>..."
4154,“The Eorzean diet largely consists of popotoes rather than rice.”
4155,I was just resting my eyes!
4156,All this reading is making me sleepy!
4157,Spinny spin spin!
4158,Tell me more about Eorzea!
4159,I wonder who carried all these big crates?
4160,Seems straight enough to me.
4161,I'll be a lot happier once we get that roof up!
4162,Can't have any of these logs rolling off and squashing someone!
4163,And she told me to mind my own business!
4164,Perhaps I will have more luck with this one?
4165,"I'm not pushing myself up,
I'm pushing the earth down!"
4166,"I hear squats cure baldness!
If not, I could always buy a wig..."
4167,Not a bad selection.
4168,"Put your back into it, lad!"
4169,These are the resources we need from the Shazenkai.
4170,These should hold up...
4171,"Gah! No more nails! I'll just keep tapping these ones, then."
4172,"Would somebody open the door, please?"
4173,I could swear I heard a voice...
4174,What should we do with all these leftover explosives?
4175,Why don't I take over?
4176,"Take this, Garlean...rubble!"
4177,"By the kami, it's hot out here!"
4178,"Say, friend, you are looking rather “board.” Hur hur!"
4179,"I wandered lonely as a pond...
No, that doesn't sound right..."
4180,"Never, never again!
This I do solemnly swear..."
4181,No one is allowed past this point.
4182,But I must have those herbs!
4183,"I'm looking for a Lupin boy.
Have you seen him?"
4184,Can't say I have.
4185,We cannot see anything from here!
4186,"As soon as this is finished, we go in search of Hien!"
4187,Wretched cat...I was only trying to help! Now I'm the one who needs saving!
4188,Meow!
4189,"I am a bunshin, yes, yes."
4190,"Shapeshifter, eh? Show me
what you've got!"
4191,"Heh, all right!
I'll show you “you”!"
4192,"How 'bout it?
We could be twins!"
4193,"A rat? A <Emphasis>rat</Emphasis>!?
I am an otter, good sir!"
4194,We once had cuisine...
4195,Possibilities abound...
4196,A bold move...
4197,"See a fire, raise the alarum!"
4198,"At last, the scales have
fallen from my eyes..."
4199,"Eyes bigger than
my stomach..."
4200,How about...this!?
4201,"Eh. Same as the last
two dozen times..."
4202,I could just drift off...
4203,"You really shouldn't,
you know..."
4204,"There, there,
that's a good girl..."
4205,"Kweh, kweh!"
4206,I ain't no bloody miner...
4207,"Yes, well, we've all got
to help however we can."
4208,"We ain't gotta dream
no more..."
4209,"Help wanted! High wages!
Meals provided! "
4210,Things are starting to look up.
4211,"Right, then. Let's be about it!"
4212,"If the terms are to my liking.
I've got options, you know."
4213,"Folks can say what they like.
I'd still hold your purse close."
4214,"Past time we had
proper materials."
4215,Bloody oath.
4216,"Aye, I got a job. Still living
in a bloody tent for all
the good it's done me."
4217,"It's better than before,
but that ain't saying much..."
4218,"Today, we work..."
4219,"Tomorrow, we eat the rich!"
4220,"Pulled me groin
with all that honest work─"
4221,"Whatever you're about
to ask, don't."
4222,"So one of those fat merchants
offered to make me his slave..."
4223,"Me too. Let's both say yes
and kill him while he sleeps."
4224,"It's not the same
without them."
4225,"Perhaps we too should
return to Ala Mhigo..."
4226,Thus begins my empire...
4227,"You'll be buying it
for a good deal more!"
4228,"What ever do you have
in that pot? It smells
absolutely heavenly!"
4229,"Some of Stonesthrow's
extra-special stew, sir!"
4230,"You an old customer?
Sorry, but I don't do that
kind of work anymore."
4231,"What shall I treat
the boy to today...?"
4232,"Fair enough, fair enough..."
4233,The rabble's in high spirits...
4234,"You have been in that pot long enough, yes, yes?"
4235,"Why must you torment me, you furry fiend!?"
4236,"My, what big ears you have!"
4237,All the better to hear you with.
4238,What do you mean by that?
4239,Hien would never expect us to chase after him in a boat!
4240,Is this the only way? I'm feeling a little queasy...
4241,"You're welcome to swim alongside, if you prefer!"
4242,"Considering how long we spent on that boat, we must be in Eorzea by now."
4243,"Brothers, down here! Help me!"
4244,Do you think we'll see those Buduga men again?
4245,"Well, last I heard, they're heading west from Kugane."
4246,"They still haven't given up on Lord Hien, then..."
4247,"You have to admire their determination, if nothing else."
4248,"My Ala Mhigan contacts
are up to the challenge."
4249,"This selection is impressive,
but I'm looking for something
especially rare..."
4250,♪♪♪
4251,"What were you expecting?
A sabotender?"
4252,Fungahhhhhh!
4253,That's the way! 
4254,"Steady your hand
and aim true."
4255,I have a feeling your talents lie elsewhere...
4256,Perhaps I should craft us an egg instead?
4257,Matron's teats! How did I let them talk me into this?
4258,A new chapter in the legend of M'zhet Tia begins today!
4259,"A self-proclaimed future nunh he may be, but a puzzle-solving genius he is not."
4260,Oh! You two have made a new friend!
4261,He's so warm and fluffy! Can I keep him?
4262,"Watch your fingers, Khloe! He looks sort of...<Emphasis>bitey</Emphasis> to me."
4263,It seems I must petition the elementals for aid.
4264,Spiky man! Scary man!
4265,Fancy seeing you here...
4266,"By the kami, what now..."
4267,"For our next bit, all three
of us will double “you”!"
4268,"Don't do it! Don't you dare
pull a Genbu!"
4269,"Perish the thought!
Now watch!"
4270,"How 'bout it?
We could be quadruplets!"
4271,"Oh, well done you!
I'm sure no one saw
that one coming! Bah!"
4272,W-Would you like to try the ceremony with me?
4273,I'd <Emphasis>love</Emphasis> to!
4274,"Hah!
One more time, then."
4275,"Let's go again, Granddad!"
4276,The bulletin... Have to check the bulletin...
4277,"Heh heh, clowns are funny."
4278,Did you check the bulletin?
4279,"I...uh... No, miss..."
4280,<sigh> Go. Check. The bulletin.
4281,"Over there, eh?"
4282,Huh? Was sure this is the spot...
4283,"Has to be here, then!"
4284,...No? Godsdammit!
4285,Where's this supposed to go?
4286,
4287,Haven't you stared long enough?
4288,"No, it's not nearly seared into my brain!"
4289,
4290,I pray this will be enough.
4291,"We have no reason to believe
the barrier will not hold."
4292,"Yet if they should bring
all to bear against us..."
4293,"We should send out a
reconnaissance team."
4294,I will do whatever it takes to save my patients. Whatever it takes!
4295,"There's nothin' more beautiful
than a sunset on the Rhotano."
4296,I pray I live to see it...
4297,"I fear we lack the numbers
to hold out..."
4298,"Then we must call for
reinforcements."
4299,We must protect the border at all costs.
4300,Till our dyin' breaths.
4301,Argh...
4302,I can't feel my legs...
4303,"Only once before have
I bowed my head low..."
4304,My body is ready for a hot meal.
4305,As soon as our watch is over.
4306,"Gods, what I wouldn't give for a bath..."
4307,●仮設定
4308,That doesn't look half bad...
4309,"Sure, I'll give it a try."
4310,I'd buy that for a gil...
4311,Down the hatch!
4312,"The path to riches is a perilous one, yes, yes..."
4313,"Seven hells!
Get a bloody room, will ye!?"
4314,The next match is mine!
4315,"Mewling cub!
You'll never defeat me!"
4316,I'll show ye how to swing a damn hammer!
4317,The abyss take me...
4318,Wh-Which tile should I discard...?
4319,"Well, this is a disaster!"
4320,And one is meant to scale this edifice...?
4321,Ulalaaa!
4322,I love you!
4323,Mashaaa!
4324,Yes!
4325,U-lah-lah!
4326,Hah! Hah!
4327,Narumiii!
4328,She looked at me!
4329,W-We're safe...?
4330,The sky...
4331,What's happening...?
4332,Lord...Vauthry...
4333,Long may...you reign...
4334,Ohhh...
4335,Hallowed be his name...
4336,Blessed is the meol...
4337,Is this supposed to be part of the show?
4338,Something's happening...
4339,Did you summon those things!?
4340,What in the gods' name is that!?
4341,That way! The crown's that way!
4342,Keep running! You're almost there!
4343,"Phew, we did it..."
4344,Time to collect our prize.
4345,I daresay they've had their fill of sport.
4346,Is... Is it over?
4347,Their mastery over glamours is truly astounding.
4348,"It was no less than what
I expected, but─well done."
4349,Alisaie...
4350,Rest well...
4351,"A Lightwarden, gone.
I can scarce believe it."
4352,"Good. Keep that
memory with you."
4353,"That Lightwarden...
That was <Emphasis>terrifying</Emphasis>."
4354,And thus doth the night return.
4355,So the Warden of the wood falls.
4356,We've taken back the darkness!
4357,At last.
4358,It seems that Ryne was correct.
4359,Thank goodness we succeeded.
4360,"That was a passing
strange form for an eater."
4361,Are you at all injured?
4362,Vauthry awaits.
4363,It's the moment of truth.
4364,"No eaters remain to
stand in our way."
4365,"I feel it above─
a powerful light."
4366,"All has gone to plan thus far.
...To the extent there <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> a plan."
4367,"An eater that only makes
the others fiercer. Lovely."
4368,We shall not falter!
4369,"Not for despair, nor fate itself."
4370,"Be on your guard.
This is wholly his realm."
4371,<Emphasis>Where</Emphasis> is Emet-Selch?
4372,"This is it─the
first and final end."
4373,The unwinding of life itself...
4374,One cannot help but pity Vauthry...
4375,"Finally, all the Lightwardens are gone..."
4376,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
4377,What should we do when we find them?
4378,We send them flying! Tee hee!
4379,Aaany moment now...
4380,D-Don't let them eat me!
4381,What in the world...?
4382,What's wrong with everyone? 
4383,Where...where am I?
4384,Ungh... My head...
4385,Long live...Lord Vauthry?
4386,It was awful... <sob>
4387,Are you all right?
4388,Zzzzzz...
4389,<snore> <snore>
4390,<slurp> <snort>
4391,"Wake up, damn you!"
4392,What's happening!?
4393,It's the dust! Don't breathe in the dust!
4394,Keep an eye on them buggers!
4395,We're gonna need more meat...
4396,"Who's a pretty girl, then?"
4397,I think...<hic>...I've had enough...
4398,"Whisk, whisk until it's mixed!♪"
4399,"Grab a seat!
...And a mug!"
4400,You do too much...
4401,"Ugh, I need a drink..."
4402,"Aye, that hits the spot!"
4403,Lali-hooo!
4404,La... La...li...ho!
4405,Hup! Ha!
4406,"No swivin' Goggs about, then?"
4407,B-Blast! It's higher than I thought...
4408,No rips that I can see...
4409,Heading in for a pint?
4410,We've got to protect our food stores!
4411,Is there aught else you need?
4412,"I'm fine for now, thanks."
4413,Just a few more rows!
4414,Hey! We're meant to do our chores first!
4415,Wait!
4416,I'm gonna get you!
4417,Yay! I got you!
4418,Nuh-uh! I let you catch me!
4419,That's enough! You're <Emphasis>both</Emphasis> winners.
4420,Let's play catch-the-kitten!
4421,"All right, you go first!"
4422,"This way, slowpoke!"
4423,Almost time to eat!
4424,W-We'll get you some medicine...
4425,It's gotta be cooked by now...
4426,Did you hear what happened to that girl!?
4427,That ought to keep the wind out.
4428,"Please...
Whatever you can spare..."
4429,Maybe I should join him...
4430,But the letter from the Crystarium said...
4431,I hope this crop turns out better than the last...
4432,Don't you wag your finger at me!
4433,I once knew twins who had hair just like yours!
4434,We'd best scout the area first.
4435,You can cross that bridge when you come to it.
4436,The forest calls to me...
4437,I am not lying! I saw it!
4438,"Well, if the others don't get here soon, we'll have to eat their share!"
4439,"Give me a moment, would you? I'm sure it's crooked!"
4440,"That is what Uimet said, anyway."
4441,"It is probably true, in that case."
4442,Is everything ready?
4443,Master Lanille has taken care of it.
4444,Then I shall return to my post.
4445,"I'd better count them again, just to be sure."
4446,"Yes, yes! Adorable!"
4447,There must be at least one shiny here!
4448,"Not a bad price, all things considered."
4449,"I'll get us a good deal, don't you worry!"
4450,"Now, you stay right there!"
4451,Hmm? Where did it go?
4452,I take my eyes off of it for one moment...
4453,Come back here!
4454,Not again!
4455,"Not good, not good..."
4456,There it is!
4457,"You must not wander off like that, understood?"
4458,That's a fair point...
4459,I have a feeling I've forgotten something.
4460,"Come now, you mustn't fret."
4461,"It never ceases to amaze.
Every time I see it..."
4462,What am I supposed to do now!?
4463,"A tasty morsel of information, yes?"
4464,Leave no stone unturned...
4465,To see a sin eater from so close... I will never forget it.
4466,And we'll split the profits!
4467,"Yes, it's all here, as agreed."
4468,"So, ready to get back to work?"
4469,Not yet. Still coughing up grey phlegm.
4470,Erm... You might wanna get that looked at...
4471,The Fuath are nothing but trouble!
4472,As my master always used to say...
4473,"Yes, better than boiling them, methinks."
4474,"A fair trade, it would seem."
4475,"A bit on the small side, perhaps..."
4476,Slowly but surely do the mushrooms grow.
4477,The blue one... Or the other blue one... Hmm...
4478,I am sure my eyesight is getting worse.
4479,Oh! This is a heavy one!
4480,"Gather round, little ones."
4481,And we'll call it “Delta Attack!”
4482,Let's try shapechanging!
4483,That sounds like fun!
4484,Watch this!
4485,Ooh! I can't wait to see this!
4486,"Piff, paff, poff!"
4487,Eek!
4488,Oink!
4489,Hee hee! How terribly amusing!
4490,Haha! A porxie!
4491,Oink! Oink!
4492,Now I just need to work out how to reverse it...
4493,Wait for me!
4494,Come back!
4495,Ummm...
4496,It's a beaver!
4497,Snook!
4498,You'll never catch me!
4499,Snook! Chit!
4500,I wonder who pushed up <Emphasis>these</Emphasis> daisies?
4501,"If I eat the whole thing, I shall go “pop!”"
4502,All this frolicking has worn me out...
4503,Haven't you had enough!?
4504,"Come on, lazy bones! There's frolicking to be done!"
4505,So soft... So fluffy...
4506,No one can fly higher than meee～♪
4507,"Now you see me, now you don't!"
4508,Found me again! I'll have to try harder!
4509,Very good! Let's see if you can find me again!
4510,Ooh! You won't be so lucky next time!
4511,You're fun! Bye for now!
4512,"Come now, don't sulk! Here, I brought you a flower!"
4513,You're like a walking cloud!
4514,And they'll never suspect a thing!
4515,Hurry up and grow!
4516,"Please, anything you can spare!"
4517,That's what you get for pushing your luck!
4518,"Nana nana nana nana, fishing!"
4519,A steal at half the price!
4520,My fortune is just a few scoops of dirt away!
4521,"As soon as his back's turned, that soup is mine!"
4522,"Next time, I'll set the line a bit lower."
4523,Why must there be so many rules?
4524,I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
4525,Why are they eating pebbles?
4526,Oh no! It looks like I've burnt it!
4527,He's gonna eat his face off! I can't wait!
4528,Go for the ribs! Don't let that bastard breathe!
4529,"One good gust of wind, and the whole thing'll come down."
4530,Maybe it's time to flip them over?
4531,"Take that, you bastard nail! And that!"
4532,This burgling lark's harder than I thought!
4533,"If I stay drunk, I'll never get hungover!"
4534,"Stick to the plan, and we can't fail!"
4535,Why must this take so long?
4536,They're sure to be impressed by my posing!
4537,Maybe I should draw the curtain...
4538,"Be a good boy and fetch me some wine, would you?"
4539,"Yes, milady."
4540,I had hoped there would be something in the Buttress to entertain me...
4541,...but it seems I was mistaken.
4542,Back to the Understory it is.
4543,"Your wine, milady."
4544,Tsk! That bloody fickle cow!
4545,"""Where? Up your arse and 'round the corner!“ Ha!"
4546,I wish they'd make these eyeholes a bit bigger.
4547,Time for a stroll...
4548,...to the parlor!
4549,And then the wretched pauper split his head open! Hilarious!
4550,"It's my money, and I'll spend it how I please!"
4551,"But, of courshe─hic!─the eldersh musht never know of thish!"
4552,"Oh, don't you worry about that, my friend!"
4553,"Haha! How very unlike you, Oboro!"
4554,Hic! Perhapsh I have partaken a bit more than─hic─ushual...
4555,I tire of this place. Come.
4556,"Yes, my lady."
4557,How frightfully vulgar!
4558,I quite agree.
4559,"Silence! When I want your opinion, I will ask for it!"
4560,"Yes, my lady!"
4561,What I would not give for some stimulating conversation...
4562,"One day, I shall buy this plaza and decorate in the manner of my choosing."
4563,"Yes, my lady..."
4564,"Care for a drink, sir?"
4565,Can you not see I am busy!?
4566,I can't even give this stuff away...
4567,Why will no one take a drink?
4568,Maybe you should be more assertive?
4569,"All right, I'll try."
4570,Are you sure we haven't got anything better?
4571,"Marry me, and you shall have everything you could wish for!"
4572,It's about time I changed the string.
4573,Oh my! How did you get so dusty?
4574,"All right, you've made your point!"
4575,I'd stick to the path if I were you.
4576,But I'm ready for the front line!
4577,This ought to last us a while.
4578,I'll work off this beer belly eventually!
4579,"There'll be no trouble, I swear!"
4580,"There's something down there, I know it!"
4581,Whoever built this thing must've been in a hurry.
4582,Nothing to report!
4583,"You'd better do one more circuit, just to be sure."
4584,"Yes, yes... I know how to do my job, thanks."
4585,"Soon, my pretty, soon..."
4586,I could put one in that smug prick's back from up here. He wouldn't even know what hit him...
4587,And we even managed to get the best room they have!
4588,We should get away like this more often.
4589,What could you have been doing to end up in such a state?
4590,"Yes, but I hear enormous swords are all the rage!"
4591,I want to see those noses touch the ground!
4592,"If we pull this off, we'll make a killing!"
4593,I swear my eyesight's getting worse...
4594,"If I see you sleeping on the job again, you'll be on latrine duty until I say you've had enough!"
4595,I have a feeling I'm in the wrong place...
4596,These feathers would fetch a gil or two...
4597,<pant> <pant>
4598,This is madness...
4599,Wh-What do we do...?
4600,Aaah!
4601,Shall we?
4602,Lead the way.
4603,And here we have the Rotunda.
4604,"Watering, watering, all day long! "
4605,All finished!
4606,Good work.
4607,Here's the next batch.
4608,"So, I should scatter these in the same place."
4609,That's right!
4610,And what comes after that?
4611,"Yes, four apples, seven lemons. How many times must you count them!?"
4612,My achin' bones...
4613,"If I stare at those crates long enough, maybe they will move themselves."
4614,Marvelous! Splendid!
4615,I fear this disagrees with my aesthetic sensibilities...
4616,This one might do...
4617,So? Find anything?
4618,I did indeed!
4619,And the reward is not bad either!
4620,Such vibrant colors!
4621,Where could it have gone?
4622,I'm sure it wouldn't sprout legs and walk off by itself.
4623,Perhaps it found its way over here?
4624,Or perhaps not.
4625,Maybe it's lurking in here?
4626,I do not see that posing any difficulties.
4627,"“By the time you read this, I shall surely be...”"
4628,"Well, perhaps if you'd brushed your hair away from your eyes, you'd have seen it!"
4629,"I should take another look, just in case."
4630,But that would mean that cucumbers are fruit...
4631,"We're still waiting for those new ladders to be delivered, I'm afraid."
4632,“...and ripped out his still-beating heart...”
4633,I can never find what I'm looking for.
4634,Something about needles and haystacks springs to mind...
4635,Would it kill them to organize things a bit better?
4636,Who needs ladders when you have magic!
4637,"So, where is it?"
4638,Erm...
4639,"I didn't ask for an “erm,” did I?"
4640,It should be ready soon.
4641,Any idea how soon?
4642,I'm afraid not.
4643,Hopefully it won't explode this time...
4644,"Sir, yes, sir!"
4645,You call that a squat!?
4646,Is everything here yet?
4647,How goes it?
4648,"Well, it could be worse!"
4649,Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
4650,Understood!
4651,Maybe I should lighten the load...
4652,I concur.
4653,"Well, there goes my lunch..."
4654,Take it or leave it!
4655,I wonder what the problem is...
4656,I'd best make a note of this.
4657,Everything seems fine here.
4658,"Not great, but acceptable."
4659,Are you sure you don't need any?
4660,"For the last time, no!"
4661,Oh... I see.
4662,I'll try asking again.
4663,"He's persistent, I'll give him that."
4664,"Oh gods, I think I've torn my breeches!"
4665,How remarkably informative...
4666,"He held an axe in each hand, and another with his tail!"
4667,We have every garment the discerning professional could possibly need!
4668,It will make a fine gift.
4669,What could possibly go wrong?
4670,You certainly have an eye for quality!
4671,Stop whining!
4672,I'll show her! I can live on stolen bread!
4673,Think of the profits we'll make!
4674,So she told him to take a long walk off a short pier!
4675,I shall leave it to the chef's discretion.
4676,It all seems in order.
4677,Thank you for keeping an eye on it!
4678,Don't mention it!
4679,"Hmm... No leaks, no strange noises..."
4680,What say you? Are you in?
4681,It might be easier to shoot them down with my bow.
4682,"Yes, about my room..."
4683,I wonder which is the biggest?
4684,Where did all of these crumbs come from?
4685,I'm telling you! It's true!
4686,I want to be the Exarch this time!
4687,Lali-ho!
4688,How go the repairs?
4689,It's practically like new!
4690,
4691,"Mmmmmm, tastes like samurai..."
4692,I'll have a dozen.
4693,Can't talk─gotta train!
4694,"If you gaze too long into the forest, the forest also gazes into you... "
4695,"And for my next trick, a handstand!"
4696,"Finlesss one, eh?"
4697,I have a quessstion...
4698,Are you just going to ssstand there all day!?
4699,But it is ssso dry!
4700,"But when you consider the
implications of this latest
calamity, you must admit..."
4701,"Trust in the scholars.
They will find a solution."
4702,"What a precocious
little child!"
4703,"If you could perhaps
explain the finer points
of the creation process..."
4704,"Yes, yes. Quite right..."
4705,"Citizens must be held
to a higher standard..."
4706,"They've convened an
emergency assembly."
4707,This concerns us all.
4708,Agreed. We must hurry...
4709,"There's an incredible
concept I just know
you'll adore..."
4710,"You... I know...
No, never mind."
4711,"The subject's potential
is far beyond our
wildest expectations..."
4712,Where to put this...?
4713,"I'm all for people having fun, but can't they learn to pick up after themselves?"
4714,"It's a mess, all right. But it could have been worse."
4715,Look what I found!
4716,We have to clean up this mess before Master Gegeruju sees it...
4717,Even pirates clean up better than this!
4718,At least all the squatting I'm doing is good for my thighs...
4719,My muscles shine even brighter on these sparkling sands!
4720,"As if it weren't bad enough already, the debris keeps floating in..."
4721,"We need to clean up before the Rising! Or wait, has it already started?"
4722,"It's a hassle, all right, but we can't just leave this trash here..."
4723,Is that the last of it?
4724,Where do empty bottles go again...?
4725,All that digging makes me sleepy!
4726,Mummy!
4727,Just try to relax a little!
4728,Sh-Shut up already!
4729,"So, are you going to jump any time soon?"
4730,Where do I go for the bomb dance?
4731,I think I need a rest...
4732,I don't even want to <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> about climbing that!
4733,Look at me! I'm a pirate! Yarr!
4734,I suppose it's not <Emphasis>too</Emphasis> far down...
4735,How am I supposed to get up <Emphasis>there</Emphasis>!?
4736,Hah! Getting to the top is child's play!
4737,Phew! Almost there!
4738,"I don't have the nerve to try myself, but I do enjoy watching!"
4739,They really saved the best for last...
4740,I know you can do it!
4741,What's most important is that you have fun!
4742,What are you waiting for!? Give it a try!
4743,"Only way to get there is from above, it seems."
4744,Look! It's a slide!
4745,You're going to climb up there? That looks so scary!
4746,I hear there's a nice place to rest there!
4747,"Ooh, look at those muscular thighs!"
4748,Muscle-heads? Love 'em!
4749,Put those muscles to work and climb to the top!
4750,I will have my revenge! My vengeance! My re-vengeance!
4751,Hey! Don't rock the boat!
4752,B-But this is only the beginning!
4753,Is this the secret route everyone's talking about?
4754,I'm going to make it this time!
4755,Urgh...
4756,Shall we dance?
4757,"A-one, and a-two, and a-one, and a-two!"
4758,There's nothing like dancing your worries away!
4759,They have the battered fish again this year!
4760,Ooh! Let's get some and eat it on the beach!
4761,The wind calls us. Run as fast as your legs carry you and soar into the air.
4762,There's no festival fairer than the Moonfire Faire!
4763,I can't wait to write a story about this!
4764,You did it! Congratulations!
4765,You're really something else!
4766,Incredible! You're my hero!
4767,"Hey, haven't I seen you before? Good job, either way!"
4768,I knew you could do it again!
4769,I've always admired you!
4770,Go get 'em!
4771,I'm so glad I could bring them here. Wait...have they eaten yet?
4772,"So this is the festival I read about... A truly magical occasion, indeed!"
4773,How I hate ships... I think I'm going to be─urk!
4774,"Heat-resistant garb? Well, well, I would like to try making that!"
4775,I do wish those ladies would be quiet. They're scaring all the fish away.
4776,This bleedin' lout keeps catchin' my godsdamned fish before I can!
4777,"Hah! As easy as baking pineapple pie, I say!"
4778,Does this mean I'll be able to see the chief in a bathing suit!?
4779,Swish-swish-aroo!
4780,"Naps dna kcips.
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4781,"Eb nac naelc sa nealc!
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4782,"Mottob ot pot morf!
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4783,"Yaws dna peews!
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4784,"Degrup eb tsum sniats!
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4785,"Naelc ot evil I!
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4786,"Burcs, burcs, burcs!
Swish-swish-aroo!"
4787,"There, there, lad. You're going to be all right."
4788,Know the reconstruction plan like the back of your hand!
4789,No! Up here!
4790,"This is where it goes, right, miss?"
4791,The inspector was right. This scenery shall make a fine subject for my masterpiece.
4792,This stew certainly tastes...interesting.
4793,"No! Up the stairs, I said!"
4794,"Straight ahead, right, miss?"
4795,We worked hard! Now we rest hard!
4796,Watch your step or you'll break your neck!
4797,Where in the world did he go?
4798,Where in the world am I?
4799,"Mmmmmm, stew..."
4800,"Relax, he'll find his way back."
4801,"Sir, one of the workers has disappeared!"
4802,Stay sharp! The briefest lapse in concentration can have lasting consequences!
4803,I've been searching high and low for you!
4804,"Sorry, miss... I got a little spun around..."
4805,Concerted works starting soon.
4806,Let's show 'em what we can do.
4807,This is it! Let's make it count!
4808,Yah!
4809,
4810,I've never climbed so high!
4811,Hmph. Well fought.
4812,"Why climb, when you can fly? Just think happy thoughts!"
4813,"Pretty, aren't they?"
4814,Zzzzzz...
4815,(Don't make a sound! They've fallen asleep!)
4816,"Come on, you can do it!"
4817,I-I'm not sure about this...
4818,Flowers! We need more flowers!
4819,"Bloom for me, my lovelies!"
4820,"Hehe, that's better! And on we go!"
4821,Whoa! What is this place!?
4822,Put that book away and come play!
4823,"Let me finish this page, all right?"
4824,"Perhaps we can give her a little push, tee hee!"
4825,A rainbow! It's so beautiful!
4826,I wish Mummy could see this too!
4827,Do you think we can walk on it?
4828,You suppose it's all right to have a bite...?
4829,I want this in the Crystarium!
4830,Ahhh! He's adorable!
4831,Amazing! It's all made from sweets!
4832,"Oh, don't even think about it! You'll make Tyr Beq mad!"
4833,Do you know what this place is missing? Leafmen!
4834,<rumble> <rumble>
4835,<rumble> <rumble>
4836,"Finally, a palatable dish."
4837,Oh my! This is delicious!
4838,This is absolutely divine.
4839,What a lovely meal.
4840,My compliments to the chef.
4841,To Lord Tolthewil! Long may he reign!
4842,"Be welcome, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>good sir</If>."
4843,As you wish.
4844,"The next time you step on my toes, dear, it shall be the last."
4845,"One-two-three,
One-two-three."
4846,It's all in the hips.
4847,<gasp> Would he truly say such things?
4848,We should hold a contest.
4849,You're quite light on your feet.
4850,Hahaha.
4851,"Come, let us put on a show!"
4852,"That's the way.
Now, follow my lead."
4853,Watch your step.
4854,Hehehe.
4855,A lovely thought.
4856,"Keep smiling dear.
We have to keep smiling..."
4857,Would that I could dance so wonderfully. Alas...
4858,"How am I doing, dear?"
4859,I see you've been practicing.
4860,"Relax, darling, you're doing fine."
4861,"If this is a dream, I hope to never wake."
4862,Aren't you glad we came?
4863,Hm? Who is that?
4864,A guest of His Majesty?
4865,Will His Majesty be joining us?
4866,"I cannot dance another step. A moment, I prithee..."
4867,"If there is aught you require, pray do not hesitate to ask."
4868,"Go ahead, eat until you're fit to burst!"
4869,"Well, if you put your mind to it, you could turn into a big tree yourself!"
4870,I wish I was as big as that tree!
4871,"If we use those big mushrooms, we can reach the top!"
4872,And there might even be hidden treasure!
4873,Last one there's a rotten egg!
4874,"Trickle, trickle! Splishy splash!"
4875,Those horrid Fuath can't spoil our fun here!
4876,Would you like me to give you a push?
4877,"Oh... It's a bit steep, isn't it?"
4878,You were as quick as lightning!
4879,Did you see how fast I went?
4880,Let's do that again!
4881,See you at the top!
4882,We should make a bridge!
4883,All the colors of the rainbow!
4884,Look at all this space! Think of the possibilities!
4885,Let's make a big tower for the children to climb!
4886,And then they can fly from the top! Tee hee!
4887,"Waterfalls are nice and all, but something is missing..."
4888,What about something slippy? Or something slidey?
4889,We should host a tea party!
4890,With lots of delicious cakes!
4891,"Or even better, a whole house made of sweets!"
4892,They obey my every command...
4893,Would that my last partner could dance so well.
4894,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, so good of you to visit!"
4895,Please have lots of fun!
4896,The children just love to lie in these and swing away.
4897,"Swinging on the wind, side and side again."
4898,To their hearts' content!
4899,Fa la la la la.♪
4900,Enterprise...engage!
4901,Hm? What's an enterprise?
4902,I've no idea. I just heard someone say it.
4903,"Oh? I guess I'll say it too, then."
4904,Enterprise...engage!
4905,"Heh, that was strangely fun!"
4906,"I know, right!?"
4907,I like flowers. They look pretty and smell nice.
4908,"Don't they, though?"
4909,Do you know what this creature is?
4910,No. Wasn't there something like it in Lydha Lran?
4911,Right. It's called a moogle.
4912,Moogle... And what's that peculiar thing attached to its head?
4913,"That's a pom-pom, and they say that real ones glow!"
4914,They glow? Really?
4915,I want one!
4916,"Does it come off the moogle, do you think?"
4917,"If you pull hard enough, sure!"
4918,Great! Let's collect lots and decorate with them!
4919,Phew. I'm glad for that to be over and done with.
4920,We'd best leave the negotiations to Alphinaud and the Exarch.
4921,Perhaps now we have afforded ourselves an audience.
4922,Now they have little choice but to hear our plea.
4923,"So, what kind of dream should we spin next?"
4924,I'm not sure. What do you think?
4925,Hmmm...
4926,How about...a great big sheep?
4927,"With all the milk it gives us, we could make a milk fountain!"
4928,Imagine it─we could drink and play at the same time!
4929,"Oh, that sounds wonderful!"
4930,Let's make lots of big sheep and drown all of Lyhe Mheg in milk!
4931,Uh... We're going to need to have a little talk...
4932,How about...a great big beast?
4933,Something that's a natural predator to the you-know-whats!
4934,Speaking of which...did you make cookies in their likeness?
4935,I did. Should I not have?
4936,"I've been seeing them a lot outside, so I thought I'd try my hand..."
4937,
4938,
4939,I must be careful.
4940,Perhaps it'd be best to approach from the rear.
4941,Oh! Its back is turned!
4942,I pray this works...
4943,Curses. It's not alone.
4944,"Calm yourself, old boy. Everything will be fine."
4945,An opening!
4946,Please don't turn around!
4947,
4948,
4949,Oh no! I've been spotted!
4950,Isn't red such a lovely color? I certainly think so.
4951,What lovely decorations!
4952,"Oh, what I wouldn't give to sing on this stage!"
4953,I can just feel inspiration about to strike...
4954,Who has time for ardor and affection? We have a job to do...
4955,This is an unusual color to see at this time of year...
4956,"Cheer up, won't you? Things will go better next time. I'm sure of it!"
4957,"Come, now. Let's give it another try!"
4958,Gah! It's seen me!
4959,B-B-Bombs!
4960,Is it over?
4961,Phew.
4962,We can't be sure. Stay vigilant.
4963,Are you ready...to be <Emphasis>supervised</Emphasis>!?
4964,"Yes. Yes, we are."
4965,Yeah!
4966,Am I ever!?
4967,"Ready and willing, sir!"
4968,Help! Somebody help!
4969,Steady does it...
4970,"Sir, yes, sir!"
4971,Mustn't waste a single plank.
4972,Could use some shelves...
4973,Bet I can throw this further than you!
4974,Bet you can't!
4975,It's a grown-up! Run!
4976,W-We weren't being naughty or anything!
4977,"Ugh, my back..."
4978,"Yes, Chief!"
4979,Is there anything I can do?
4980,Hm... Where do we need hands right now?
4981,Let's see...
4982,"Well and good to work hard, but you've got to rest as well."
4983,B-B-Bloody hells it's cold!
4984,Huh? Where did I put that nail?
4985,Do you have enough hands?
4986,"Aye, we're good here."
4987,We could use help with some procurement.
4988,"I don't know much about braziers, but I know what I like."
4989,"I'll be careful, Chief!"
4990,A fine feeling watching the place transform.
4991,"There's still a long way to go, but we'll get there."
4992,Whoa!
4993,This is amazing!
4994,These special ingredients will keep our workers going all day long!
4995,Wh-What did I just eat?
4996,That's a mild way to put it.
4997,"Hmmm, toasty..."
4998,"Yes, rest up and be ready for more!"
4999,Yeah!
5000,"Get back here, you!"
5001,I can't bear all this waiting around...
5002,Plain sailing ahead!
5003,"I'd never shirk my duties as helmsman, but sometimes I do miss the days when it was just me and my rod."
5004,"Lucky for you I'm a fisher myself, so I know that slow and steady brings the bites. "
5005,"Never fails to take your breath away, does it?"
5006,I'd best write today's log before I forget...
5007,It's hard to keep a steady hand when the ocean's beauty is distracting me.
5008,"I must record every detail of the day's weather conditions. Tedious work, but it must be done. "
5009,Get your rods ready─here comes enough fish for the lot of you!
5010,And we're here! Time to fish!
5011,Looks like handsome hauls all around!
5012,"Oi, can you hear me? Hey! Ahoy there! "
5013,There's no mistaking this light─we've found ourselves a spectral current!
5014,"Ain't got no need for small fry, so I throw 'em right back to the sea."
5015,"Ye ain't gotta see a fish to know its size! Mark well how long it takes to bite, and how fiercely it pulls."
5016,An expert angler's got two qualities: patience and a discernin' eye. Don't waste time pullin' minnows outta the sea.
5017,"One cast, one catch!"
5018,"To catch a fish that's bein' conservative with its bites, you'll need to use your precision hookset."
5019,"If a fish is pullin' with the strength of an aurochs, you'll need a powerful hookset to match it."
5020,"If ye wanna get straight to fishin', spread some chum in the water and watch the fish crowd around!"
5021,Now do some fishin' of yer own!
5022,"Not every kind of bait will have fish chomping at your hook right away. However, patience is a virtue every fisher's got."
5023,Rumor has it the bait they sell on the boat's what you want to use if it's the size of the catch you care about.
5024,The ocean's full of hungry beasts all waiting for food to drop in front of their gullets─I've even seen shellfish at the end of some hooks!
5025,Now take your fill of the ocean's bounty!
5026,Look at this! We're above the clouds!
5027,Wow! The sea of clouds puts the real sea to shame!
5028,"Come on, let's go play over there!"
5029,Where am I? ...<Emphasis>Who</Emphasis> am I?
5030,
5031,"This is unacceptable! Unacceptable, I tell you!"
5032,It's off to the hole with you.
5033,"No, please! Anythin' but that!"
5034,The king's will be done!
5035,Yah!
5036,"The remaining benthos may struggle, bereft of leader..."
5037,"Come now, she <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> maniacal."
5038,"If there were more guards, they would be here by now."
5039,That was all of them? Every last one...?
5040,'Tis a boon we find this sanctum intact.
5041,We may at last turn our attention to investigation.
5042,My name shall be inscribed in the pages of history!
5043,"Not if you stand around talking all day, it won't."
5044,"Ox'Dalan, grant me thy strength. And wisdom. And perhaps some extra luck wouldn't go amiss..."
5045,"Surely, you have chiseled enough?"
5046,It's my turn!
5047,No! I must continue chiseling!
5048,Tradition dictates it!
5049,Our ancestors would be proud!
5050,No thanks to your incessant chiseling.
5051,Scree!
5052,So many tunnels and grottoes...
5053,Scree! Scree!♪
5054,"And scree to you, my good sir! ...Or was it madam?"
5055,It says this is the way! ...I think.
5056,"<huff> <puff> Wait up, I say!"
5057,A warding talisman? How splendid!
5058,Let the delving continue!
5059,We are much obliged to the Night's Blessed.
5060,"The tunnels are full of shiny, sparkly ore!"
5061,We must better study how to care for the sick...
5062,Ronkan moss is very valuable. We must conserve our supply.
5063,Do you think the serpent will like this?
5064,I must prepare a herbal soak!
5065,The serpent will surely be pleased!
5066,And one! And two!
5067,<whimper>
5068,<huff> <huff> I can run...no more...
5069,Take your ease until the next stela is complete.
5070,The great serpent is pleased with our work. A rest is well deserved!
5071,Scree! Scree!
5072,Time for the next shift!
5073,"Come now, our replacements are here!"
5074,"Patience! Just a little further, a little deeper!"
5075,These vegetables from Slitherbough are positively delectable!
5076,We'll have a full stomach for a full day of mining ahead!
5077,Scree...
5078,Scree!
5079,Scree! Scree!
5080,S-Screeeeeeeee!
5081,That cargo ain't gone through inspections yet. We got rules and regulations here─yer gonna have to put it back.
5082,Where do ye want this?
5083,Ye must be jokin'...
5084,Urgh... The pain... I can't move an ilm or I'll...
5085,Just...just leave the medicine here...and go...
5086,Someone doesn't have their sea legs yet.
5087,Don't give him any ideas...
5088,"Sailed every corner of the high seas, huh?"
5089,Goes down almost as easy as it comes up!
5090,"Here, take a draught of this and you'll be set straight quick."
5091,I don't mind the taste...
5092,"Fish, of course. Oh, and here's some jewelry..."
5093,Someone said a big boat was coming. Do you see it?
5094,Help has arrived from Limsa! Feast your eyes!
5095,"Good gods, would you look at those muscles!"
5096,H-Help! Please help!
5097,Hm? Did someone say something?
5098,What in the Fury's name!? H-Hold on!
5099,Are those muscles just a glamour!?
5100,"Watch your step, now..."
5101,"Oh gods, I've got a cramp..."
5102,I'll plummet to my death one day...but not today!
5103,Ugh... What did they put in here? <huff>
5104,I-I thought I was done for! Thank you!
5105,"Be more careful, all right?"
5106,There's going to be a fountain here.
5107,"That sounds delightful, sir!"
5108,"Oh gods, not again!"
5109,I-I'm losing my grip...
5110,That voice... It couldn't be...
5111,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me..."
5112,Go over each draft at least a dozen times!
5113,"Sir, yes, sir!"
5114,"Now, according to the adventurer's recipe..."
5115,"Can't stop, won't stop!"
5116,The stew certainly has improved.
5117,Where have you been all my life!? <sob>
5118,Take that! And that!
5119,Concerted works starting soon.
5120,This is it! Let's make it count!
5121,Let's show 'em what we can do.
5122,Yah!
5123,When's the next works starting?
5124,Let's do this!
5125,Any time now. Have to make sure we're fighting fit.
5126,Right behind you!
5127,So the reconstruction finally begins in earnest.
5128,For Ishgaaaaaard! Yaaaaaargh!
5129,We don't need lumber this time. Go and put it back.
5130,"Are you sure, miss? I could've sworn..."
5131,I must─<huff>─break you! <puff>
5132,Concerted works starting soon.
5133,This is it! Let's make it count!
5134,Let's show 'em what we can do.
5135,Yah!
5136,When's the next works starting?
5137,Let's do this!
5138,Any time now. Have to make sure we're fighting fit.
5139,Right behind you!
5140,So the reconstruction finally begins in earnest.
5141,How's it looking?
5142,"That's good, clean work."
5143,Looks like it's coming along well.
5144,This fountain is going to be a masterpiece!
5145,"Very good, sir!"
5146,"All credit to the artisans, sir!"
5147,You saved me again! How can I ever repay you?
5148,Not falling again would be a start.
5149,I could sculpt all day long!
5150,"From devastation to restoration, I must commit all to my mind's eye..."
5151,"Whew, a rest at last..."
5152,Isn't this road just begging for a footrace?
5153,"Oh aye, my legs are itching for it!"
5154,The Firmament is beginning to take shape!
5155,Bet you can't catch me!
5156,Bet I can!
5157,Bet you can't!
5158,"We're waiting on supplies, so rest while you can!"
5159,"Good work, one and all!"
5160,You're only as strong...<huff>...as your squat!
5161,"We work hard, we relax hard!"
5162,By the hundredth blow! <grunt>
5163,Take care not to slip on the rubble!
5164,"Watch your footing, now..."
5165,Every swing brings us closer to our goal!
5166,"Yes, miss!"
5167,"Aye, sir!"
5168,Here's where the dais will be!
5169,These columns need a lot of attention.
5170,"Yes, miss!"
5171,"Sir, yes, sir!"
5172,"Understood, Chief!"
5173,"Ugh, my hands are falling asleep..."
5174,Make sure we have enough supplies!
5175,"Yes, that's the way."
5176,It's all in the details!
5177,"Am I doing it right, miss?"
5178,"Hm, might be a little short..."
5179,What to do with this one...
5180,"Right, next on the docket..."
5181,A fine vantage point for capturing the restoration.
5182,You'll be warm if you keep moving!
5183,Brrr... C-Can't we go somewhere warm?
5184,"Gods, but I'm spent..."
5185,You need to slow down a little.
5186,"Next, we're starting on the residential quarter!"
5187,Make sure you're well rested for it.
5188,I feel it! I feel the burn!
5189,Yes! YES! The snows of Coerthas recede before the fire in your thighs!
5190,Yaaaaaargh!
5191,"Swing with your entire body, or you'll hurt your arms!"
5192,Watch out for flying fragments!
5193,Perhaps you should have a rest...
5194,"Do I lift with me knees, or me back?"
5195,"Suppose we'll be stuck here for a while, then."
5196,You call those squats? I want to see your arse kiss the floor!
5197,"How far can we stretch this, I wonder..."
5198,"If you need supplies, you'll have to speak with Bajsaljen."
5199,Nothing but empty sea.
5200,I have to carry on. My little angel would expect me to.
5201,"Ah, blessed warmth..."
5202,Such a grand house... It's wasted on me alone.
5203,You're going to fall!
5204,We could ask the residents if they need help?
5205,How about a foray to the Diadem?
5206,I personally could use a rest...
5207,"So, what shall we do next?"
5208,"Grow, my pretties. Grow strong and rise above the cold."
5209,What I need is a family...
5210,"That's part of the fun, hee hee!"
5211,"It's all right, miss! I could do this all day!"
5212,"Sir, yes, sir!"
5213,"I will, Chief!"
5214,Much better!
5215,Looking good! Keep it up!
5216,Perhaps you should work on a smaller piece...
5217,She may as well be his personal attendant...
5218,"It's going to break any moment now, miss! I can feel it!"
5219,"How's my form, Chief?"
5220,"Thank you, sir!"
5221,Others will take care of the streets. We're looking ahead to the next stage!
5222,The pile of debris needs to go first!
5223,Do we have as many as we should?
5224,"From this rubble, a beautiful home will rise!"
5225,Let's see...
5226,"Yes, sir! I'll check the drafts!"
5227,"We'll see to it right away, sir!"
5228,It's amazing how quickly the Firmament is coming along!
5229,Aye! I can't wait to live here!
5230,Such magnificent images of the Fury!
5231,Stack it there! Take care you don't get your fingers caught!
5232,Are all the blocks in good condition?
5233,"Yes, miss! They're as solid as stone!"
5234,"Aye, sir!"
5235,Byregot guide my hand!
5236,Are you all right up there!?
5237,You've brought it all up?
5238,Are you all right!?
5239,"The nail that sticks out gets─
OWWW!"
5240,"Y-Yes, sir... Everything's spinning a little, is all..."
5241,"Aye, sir!"
5242,That should suffice for the sketch.
5243,"You've been studying the drafts, I see."
5244,It's starting to take shape! Good!
5245,Is that a crack...?
5246,"Each at least a dozen times like you said, sir!"
5247,"You're too kind, sir!"
5248,Bring in materials for the other builders too!
5249,Are you all right!?
5250,"I wonder what the kitchen's serv─
OWWW!"
5251,Coming along nicely.
5252,That's a lot of supplies.
5253,This is fine material. Handle it with care!
5254,"Mmmmmm, smooth..."
5255,"Yes, sir! We're fortunate to have so many people donating!"
5256,"Yes, sir! Of course, sir!"
5257,"Large plot, prime location... Yes, this is absolutely perfect for me."
5258,Bah!
5259,The houses are coming along nicely.
5260,"Begging your pardons, but these houses are for war-displaced Ishgardian citizens."
5261,Wait! Who are you? What business have you here?
5262,The end is in sight! Let's stay focused!
5263,"Honestly! Pay attention, will you!?"
5264,"Damn, what's the word for when you─
OWWW!"
5265,"Yes, Chief!"
5266,"A masterpiece, even if I do say so myself."
5267,"You've improved in leaps and bounds, all of you!"
5268,"Yes, you may be proud of yourselves!"
5269,<sniff> It's hard to believe we built something so beautiful.
5270,We couldn't have done it without our friends from afar!
5271,There's strength in numbers...and in huge muscles!
5272,This building shall provide affordable housing for many families.
5273,Thank you!
5274,Thank you... (I'll never live this down...)
5275,"That was a close call. Be careful next time, both of you."
5276,Behold the beauteous bladework of a Temple Knight!
5277,Feel the irrepressible power of the darkside!
5278,These houses are intended for war-displaced citizens such as your good selves.
5279,Truly? We can live here?
5280,"You'll be happy here, I promise."
5281,"When she said that she wanted a pet, I thought she had something a little smaller in mind..."
5282,N-No! You can't have any of this!
5283,"Meowww, meowww!"
5284,Meow!
5285,Where's Lord Jannequinard? He should be here by now...
5286,"Yes, sir!"
5287,Let's review our lessons while we wait!
5288,"Today, we shall learn more about the stars and their guidance."
5289,I've brought meals for the workers.
5290,Thank you! I'll see them handed out at once!
5291,"Wait, you too?"
5292,Me? I have an order for Marcelloix.
5293,<click> <click> Let us see what work there is...
5294,"If you need repairs, please don't hesitate to let me know."
5295,Thank you kindly!
5296,Uwaaah! Not me this time!? Help! Somebody help!
5297,H-Hold on!
5298,You saved me before! Now it's my turn to save you!
5299,Th-Thank heavens...
5300,"Ah, fiddlesticks! I slipped!"
5301,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me..."
5302,Let us take a look. Heh heh heh...
5303,Can you tell me my skyward scores?
5304,What's that man doing?
5305,Looks like he's painting a picture.
5306,Ughhh! I stubbed my bloody toe!
5307,"Hello again,
old friend..."
5308,...So you visit him still. He would be glad.
5309,Ooh ooh... <whimper>
5310,I see... You miss your fellows...
5311,"Yes, sir! That's very considerate of you, sir!"
5312,It's far nicer than I'd dared imagine!
5313,All's well with you and yours?
5314,To be able to live in a warm home... It's a dream come true!
5315,"There, there. Sleep now, sweetling."
5316,"Right away, sir!"
5317,<slurp> That smells amazing! Can I have a bowl?
5318,My ears are freezing! But that was so much fun!
5319,"<huff> <huff> Yeah, we've got to do it again!"
5320,Many thanks to those who came to our aid.
5321,Just a little further to go...
5322,Dare I say we've seen the last of them?
5323,They were all bathed in Light... Why?
5324,There can be no doubt─'tis indeed the Exarch's magick.
5325,"That proved quite a detour, but all's well that ends well."
5326,"Play with us, Urianger! Just a little longer!"
5327,Why tidy up now when you can do it never?
5328,Have at you!
5329,Yaaah!
5330,Here comes a big one!
5331,Stay sharp!
5332,Try this!
5333,Down with you!
5334,No you don't!
5335,Nothing I can't handle!
5336,Fly true!
5337,Darkness...must be destroyed...
5338,True peace...shall reign...
5339,In the name...of the Light...
5340,Deliverance to all...
5341,Shadow...begone...
5342,How long do you think this'll last?
5343,Who knows? I'll just take it one day at a time.
5344,"No matter what happens to this town, we'll always have the view."
5345,You're not getting out of this!
5346,What a mess!
5347,What are we supposed to do now!?
5348,Punishment! Punishment!
5349,You'd better talk fast!
5350,Good work! You've earned an extra lump of coal!
5351,<beep> Scrap collection complete.
5352,<beep> Material salvage complete.
5353,"Complete? Not yet, it ain't! Go and get some more!"
5354,First one to pass out loses!
5355,I'll...show...you!
5356,I've never slept in such a comfy bed...
5357,"<snore>
<snore>"
5358,Good. Now fill up the empty kegs!
5359,"I demand to have some booze! More booze, that is."
5360,<beep> Commencing booze acquisition.
5361,<beep> Awaiting instructions.
5362,<beep> Booze acquired.
5363,What I wouldn't give for a swig of grog!
5364,The key to Ronitt's success must be his poses. I'll start with those...
5365,"What do you think? Just like Ronitt, eh?"
5366,"This either makes us look tough, or like we're squatting for another reason entirely."
5367,"We're not shirking! This is serious work, I'd have you know!"
5368,"Yeah! We're the Croaking Bullfrogs, and we wanna be just like Ronitt!"
5369,No one messes with Ronitt! That's why he's our role model!
5370,Let me hear you shout!
5371,There you are!
5372,The perfect hiding place...
5373,Where might the others be?
5374,How did you know?
5375,Hee hee! Let's have some fun!
5376,We've been waiting for you!
5377,2P...
5378,Now what?
5379,Who the hells are they!?
5380,"Ugh, they're strong!"
5381,●バトル前２B
5382,There should be no further danger here.
5383,Oi! Where'd you put the thingamabob?
5384,Which thingamabob is that?
5385,The thingamabob with the whatsnames sticking out of it!
5386,"Why didn't you say so? It's over there, I think."
5387,The one place I hadn't looked!
5388,Wheels and gears! Gears and wheels!
5389,This way? Or this way?
5390,A tank! More metal for us!
5391,Where to start? Let's see now...
5392,This stone should still serve well...
5393,How do I even begin to repair this?
5394,Take care around the scaffold!
5395,Don't look down... Don't look down...
5396,The new building materials <Emphasis>still</Emphasis> haven't arrived?
5397,"Any moment now, I reckon..."
5398,Raaagh!
5399,Gwoooh!
5400,Nobody tosses a dwarf!
5401,"Lali, lali, lali-hoooooo!"
5402,Did you know Ronitt is the youngest?
5403,How about Karutt and Regitt?
5404,Regitt is three years older than Karutt.
5405,Ozogg is one year younger than Karutt.
5406,Ozogg is five years older than Ronitt. So how many apples does Regitt have?
5407,Please let me work here! I'll do anything!
5408,"<Emphasis>Anything</Emphasis>, you say...?"
5409,I want to serve Ishgard in any way I can!
5410,...Very well. But be warned─it's not easy work.
5411,"Ah, nothing beats the beach!"
5412,"All shark and no bite, hah!"
5413,"Ah, save me! Hold me!"
5414,I've been waiting for this day all year!
5415,She's the belle of the beach!
5416,This summer will be even better than the last!
5417,It seems awfully complicated...
5418,"The beach is the battlefield today, eh?"
5419,"Oh, what I wouldn't give to be a dancer too..."
5420,"If things're lookin' grim, I'll jump to your rescue!"
5421,Now where's this so-called monster? I'm sure it's not so tough.
5422,Legs!? It has legs!?
5423,"Oh, I just want to snuggle it!"
5424,Dance truly is a salve for the soul.
5425,This dance will keep me and mine safe!
5426,The more the merrier!
5427,Not a pixie in sight. Thought they'd play a trick on us by now.
5428,Aye. Wonder where they've all gotten to...
5429,Aye. All I see is that peculiar creature there...
5430,"Can't put my finger on it, but something doesn't feel right..."
5431,Let's report back for the time being.
5432,We've brought what you asked.
5433,"Ooh, let me see! Let me see!"
5434,"Yes, not a one more or less than requested! Many thanks!"
5435,"Great. We'll be on our way, then."
5436,"Whew, I'm glad that went well."
5437,"Aye, get the amount wrong and they'll fair bite your head off..."
5438,"Well, that was a waste of a trip."
5439,"Bah, when they told us we could trade the stones here..."
5440,They could've mentioned they don't deal in trifling quantities.
5441,That'll teach us to do our due diligence and check.
5442,Nothing for it but to go and gather some more.
5443,"Huzzah, the exit! Safe at last!"
5444,My thanks for your kind aid!
5445,Don't mention it. Just glad to be of help.
5446,"No, no, I must thank you properly. Come with me to Mord Souq!"
5447,"We shall have a feast! Yes, a feast with our finest delacies!"
5448,"Oho, we won't say no to that! Right, Theyler?"
5449,"Hm, must say I'm curious about the local cuisine..."
5450,
5451,People made this!? With those fleshy stumps?
5452,"They may be fleshy, but they are nimble, and ambitious besides."
5453,The Sea of Clouds! Have you ever been?
5454,What is your home called?
5455,Wait... Where am I?
5456,"I've come to give my regards to Ehll Tou, but I seem to have lost my way..."
5457,Many thanks! It's so easy to lose your way here.
5458,Maybe I can help. Who are you looking for?
5459,"Ah, I know her! Everyone around here does. Climb these stairs and you should spot her before long."
5460,"There shouldn't be any sharks on these shores, especially not so close..."
5461,"The next big win is mine, I can feel it!"
5462,My “Dawn Deck” will be unstoppable!
5463,Prepare to feel my fist of rage!
5464,"Oh, calm down, Ulala..."
5465,"You've the worst mahjong face, my friend..."
5466,"Hmm, what should I do now...?"
5467,<gasp> The size of this place!
5468,Where shall we start!?
5469,Just one more try...
5470,"What, again!?"
5471,There's a time for soldierin' and there's a time for loafin'.
5472,Take care not to spend too much time in the sun.
5473,"We simply must introduce this dance in Coerthas, if only to bring a mote of summer's warmth with us."
5474,So this is what an eternal summer feels like...
5475,I've never felt more alive!
5476,Good luck getting me to leave!
5477,It's so hot... Perhaps if I doffed my armor...
5478,"Come on, get in the water!"
5479,I don't ever want this celebration to end...
5480,Do you hear me!? I don't want to see a one of you slacking!
5481,My arm feels like it's about to fall off...
5482,Let's do this!
5483,Leave it to me.
5484,I'll do the heavy lifting!
5485,Take that! And that!
5486,Steady the hips...and swing!
5487,"Yes, this is quite an inspiring scene."
5488,Just look at those bulging biceps...
5489,Keep at that same spot!
5490,"Not half bad, I say."
5491,My sides are achin' somethin' fierce...
5492,How's it lookin'?
5493,"You got it, Chief!"
5494,Ungh!
5495,"Finally figured out how to use that pickaxe, I see."
5496,How about you try your hand with a hammer next?
5497,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5498,Thank ye kindly!
5499,Pound! Smash! Crash!
5500,Hyah!
5501,Let me show you how it's done.
5502,"You lift the hammer like this, then...yah!"
5503,Aha...so the secret's to take a running start!
5504,Phew! I need a rest...
5505,We should check on the others' progress.
5506,Sounds like a plan!
5507,"Is that blood? Am I bleeding!? Oh, the pain!"
5508,Do you require more supplies?
5509,Progress report! And be quick about it!
5510,Are you sure that isn't upside down?
5511,Mustn't forget to take inventory...
5512,Hm? What curious foreign tongue is this?
5513,"This should suffice for the time being, Chief."
5514,That scaffold looks awfully wobbly...
5515,"Right on schedule, Chief!"
5516,"Now, what do we need here...?"
5517,I'll see that we're all stocked up!
5518,Those are for repairing the roofs. And these...
5519,This stone should serve us well.
5520,Let's see. We still need to stock up on...
5521,Excellent. No delays here.
5522,"Now, what tasks remain undone?"
5523,My stonemasonry skills will do Ishgard proud!
5524,"This, too, would make for a stirring painting..."
5525,I'll prepare a copy of the construction schedule for you.
5526,Only the finest materials will do!
5527,"Get a hold of yourself, damn it! It's a long way down!"
5528,This should serve nicely for the floor.
5529,"This is so easy, I could do it with my eyes clo─
OWWW!"
5530,You must hone your eye for stone.
5531,Don't forget to haul the materials in the proper order!
5532,The slightest chip or crack could send the walls crashing down.
5533,"Yes, this should suffice..."
5534,Let me take another look...
5535,I'll do my best!
5536,"Aye aye, Chief!"
5537,We'll be needing extra hands for this.
5538,Watch out for your hand!
5539,Maybe carpentry isn't for you...
5540,"There's no need to rush, you know."
5541,"To build a strong foundation, every nail counts..."
5542,"I think I've finally got the hang of─
OWWW!"
5543,"A little tap here, and a little tap there..."
5544,If only I weren't so clumsy...
5545,How majestic!
5546,Such beautiful stone!
5547,Are you certain we have enough materials?
5548,Your thoroughness is admirable...
5549,I'm prone to mistakes─that's why I always check thrice!
5550,You'll find no better stone in all of Eorzea!
5551,"Fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty─wait, did I count that one twice?"
5552,If I just stack these here...
5553,This should do!
5554,"Oho! Looking good, indeed!"
5555,Steady now...
5556,Sigh... Why doesn't she ever notice me?
5557,"Watch out for the thumb...watch out for the─
OWWW!"
5558,"Heh! Lookin' good, eh?"
5559,"Fastest hammer in Ishgard, I tell you!"
5560,Eat up! You'll need all the strength you can muster for the next shift!
5561,"Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral wasn't built on an empty stomach, you know."
5562,I'm going to feel this tomorrow...
5563,Time to work off that last flagon of ale!
5564,Unnngaaah!
5565,Nnngraaaaaah!
5566,It's all in the hips...hyaaah!
5567,Right! I'll tell the others.
5568,...And that's what's on the agenda for tomorrow.
5569,Hoooh! Haaah! Hoooh! Haaah!
5570,It just won't break. Am I not doing this right?
5571,Why won't anyone look at <Emphasis>me</Emphasis>!?
5572,How do you even lift that thing?
5573,"Not easily, I'll tell you that..."
5574,Let me guess...is it pineapple!?
5575,The chef told me the secret ingredient in the stew...
5576,This shall be the scene for my next masterpiece!
5577,Restoring such a mighty structure will be no small task...!
5578,The smashing's over! It's repairing time!
5579,The damage here is even worse than I thought...
5580,What do I get to smash next!?
5581,Can this truly be restored to its former glory?
5582,"You're an inspiration to us all, Chief..."
5583,"Getting the stairwells just right is tricky, I hear..."
5584,There's nothing my muscles can't overcome!
5585,Ngggaaaaaahhh!
5586,Yaaaaaahhh!
5587,"It's all in the hips, they say!"
5588,Next up is...
5589,"Aye, this should serve nicely!"
5590,Everything appears in good order...
5591,Isn't it impressive?
5592,Look at the size of this one!
5593,That should do.
5594,Take care not to fall!
5595,"You're quite dedicated, aren't you?"
5596,A masterpiece shall be wrought...
5597,This is almost fun!
5598,I must do Ishgard proud with my stonework...
5599,"Whatever you say, Chief!"
5600,All stocked up!
5601,Hm? Did I miscount?
5602,Just like clockwork!
5603,Now where did I leave my hammer?
5604,A solid base if I ever saw one.
5605,"Looking good, I'd say."
5606,How goes it?
5607,This is the final push!
5608,Do you know a good chirurgeon? My back is killing me...
5609,That's why I told you to lift with your legs...
5610,Looking better and better!
5611,And that should do it!
5612,Isn't she a beauty?
5613,Ooh! I want to fly in that!
5614,Is it done yet?
5615,I'd say you've earned yourselves a break.
5616,"Rest up well, for there's still work to be done!"
5617,"With a bit more muscle, maybe I'd be better at this..."
5618,Your biceps! They cry out in pain!
5619,This wall appears to have escaped the war unscathed...
5620,I'll place an order. How many?
5621,We'll be needing more pickaxes.
5622,"Fine material, this!"
5623,I must take inventory and report back quickly...
5624,"...Ahhhhhh! Working so hard, sometimes I forget to breathe!"
5625,A sight to stir the heart and inspire me to the heights of creative genius!
5626,This one's sure to be his magnum opus!
5627,"Why, it's lovely!"
5628,Best rest up now before the test flight.
5629,"Yes, I could use a cup of piping hot tea."
5630,They're gone! Now's our chance!
5631,Kweh! Kweh!♪
5632,Kweh...
5633,Would you sit down?
5634,"How can I? I should be out there, cutting down imperials!"
5635,It is vital we overcome their advantage in numbers.
5636,An advantage that keeps growing. Xeven's men were hit especially hard.
5637,"The enemy could launch a surprise attack at any moment, so be prepared!"
5638,You'd be better off heading back to the infirmary and having that leg looked at.
5639,But I can still fight!
5640,"Most flattering... Ahem! For the sultana, that is."
5641,"Would that I could stay longer, but duty beckons..."
5642,I remember it as though it were yesterday.
5643,I fear the time has come for us to depart.
5644,Does Philestiaux have any new tasks that need doing?
5645,Perhaps there are supplies that need procuring.
5646,No good work ever got done on an empty stomach!
5647,I'd like nothing more than to go on a grand adventure!
5648,"I've decided to return to Limsa. My beloved may be lost forever, but at least there I have memories..."
5649,"Look, we can use this stepladder!"
5650,"Hey, wait for me!"
5651,W-Watch out!
5652,Are you sure this will suffice?
5653,Be sure to keep the inventory up to date.
5654,"You really have a way with that chisel, don't you?"
5655,"Hey, I'm no slouch myself!"
5656,"Heh! You're too kind, miss..."
5657,"This should do, Chief!"
5658,One stone on top of the next...
5659,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5660,The stairwell must be finished with all speed!
5661,One step at a time─Featherfall won't be built in a day!
5662,"Good as done, Chief!"
5663,This wall seems no worse for the wear...
5664,"Cut, lay, fit, and repeat..."
5665,Building a curved arch of stone is no small task!
5666,"Perfection is ever elusive, but I am rather pleased with how this place turned out."
5667,"I'll study well, Chief!"
5668,This magnificent window frame deserves only the finest glass...!
5669,Ishgardian architecture is truly the pride of the realm!
5670,The inclination of the slope is just as the chief calculated!
5671,Preposterous! Or is it...?
5672,They say the savior of Ishgard <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> labors among us!
5673,How is it staying in the Hoarfrost?
5674,"Why, I've never lived in such comfort!"
5675,"Oh, I've forgotten something again!"
5676,Shhh! I'm trying to hide here!
5677,Where haven't I looked...?
5678,"The captain runs a tight ship, to say the least..."
5679,"The freshest catches of the day, and exotic spices to season them! We have all you need!"
5680,What shall we order from Maisenta?
5681,Mayhap some nuts and other fruits of the forest?
5682,"By the Twelve, it's cold here! I can scarce feel my fingertips!"
5683,Do any of our fine products catch your discerning eye?
5684,"Good work, men!"
5685,Get some rest! The next stage will be a demanding one.
5686,Here's to a job well done!
5687,I could swear my biceps are bigger...
5688,My muscles haven't failed me yet!
5689,I knew I could count on you!
5690,Phew! That was the toughest job yet...
5691,My masterpiece is complete!
5692,Hey! What are you doing in there!?
5693,Get down at once─it's dangerous up there!
5694,"Manacutter, full speed ahead! Whee!"
5695,The adults are back! Let's get out of here!
5696,"I'm sorry, mister!"
5697,Practice the motion until it becomes second nature!
5698,Don't ask me! I don't know!
5699,You're always alone. Is something the matter?
5700,I lost my husband in the war...
5701,"If there's anything I can do for you, just say the word!"
5702,You're too kind...
5703,What in the─!? Noooooo!
5704,So this is the new branch of the manufactory...
5705,I can't wait to get to work!
5706,He's truly outdone himself this time.
5707,Ishgard's not so bad...once you get used to the cold.
5708,At least we won't lack for company.
5709,Leave the cooking to me!
5710,"And the manufactory's just a hop, skip, and jump away!"
5711,It's the savior of Ishgard! In the flesh! Can I shake your hand?
5712,This is sure to win her heart!
5713,This should do it!
5714,The auger's store of aether is running low...
5715,"The beaches are safe, for now... Let's hope that shark stays in the water where it belongs."
5716,"If any mean old sharks come ashore, Khloe will scare them away! Don't worry, Zhloe!"
5717,"Oh, you're Zhloe's personal hero!"
5718,"Now, let's go play on the beach!"
5719,The emissaries never give up...
5720,And neither will I!
5721,"You know, I'd love to perform here."
5722,I could sing for my friends and family...
5723,"I'll talk to the seneschal.
He wouldn't dare say no!"
5724,It's always so colorful!
5725,Did you see the costumes?
5726,"For the Songbirds?
Yes! Lisette did a fine job!"
5727,Tra la la la la.♪
5728,Do doo da doo.♪
5729,La di da dah.♪
5730,Look! It's the Songbirds!
5731,"Gosh, they're gorgeous!"
5732,Shall we watch for a while?
5733,I suppose we should go...
5734,That was so much fun!
5735,It certainly was!
5736,I feel so close to Ulala!
5737,Now that you mention it...
5738,"They do seem alike, kupo!"
5739,Ulala! Over here!
5740,Narumi! My queen!
5741,"Masha, I love you!"
5742,I adore your outfits!
5743,The Songbirds are life!
5744,I wish we could talk to Elyne again.
5745,"And Kupka, too!"
5746,"Just a little more rest, then I can see the Songbirds!"
5747,It's all so pretty!
5748,I wanted to help decorate...
5749,Oh my...
5750,
5751,
5752,Where... <pant> <pant> could she have gone?
5753,"Which do you prefer, my dear?"
5754,"Oh, the one with the ribbon is just lovely!"
5755,"Stay focused, now."
5756,Don't show any fear─they can smell it!
5757,Quite a fight she put up...
5758,Blood! Blood! Blood!
5759,One of you should take responsibility!
5760,Hurry up and punish somebody already.
5761,I'm so tired of this.
5762,I can't relax until we hang <Emphasis>someone</Emphasis> out to dry.
5763,I haven't done anything...that you can prove.
5764,I haven't slept in a week!
5765,Or twenty! Haha... Please help me.
5766,Should have all the parts you need here.
5767,The workshop seems so...peaceful.
5768,Busy time?
5769,Seems like you could use a hand.
5770,Perfect. I'll have a look.
5771,Take a break! Relax!
5772,I can't believe we're working with Neillemard!
5773,"More importantly, Nimie. Her eyes are so piercing... <sigh>"
5774,"True, but Denys is the gorgeous one..."
5775,"Wait, how long have we been out here?"
5776,I could not have asked for a better present than spending the Starlight season with you!
5777,It's a miracle I was granted a respite from my duties.
5778,"Is it just me, or do things look particularly festive this year?"
5779,We couldn't have done it without you.
5780,See those decorations? They were all mine!
5781,They're beautiful! You truly have an eye for these things...
5782,We've got some new faces joining us today!
5783,Great! We could use the help!
5784,Rookies to boss around? All right!
5785,"I'm with you, Chief!"
5786,I'll put some muscle on you!
5787,"Pray disregard my station. I will perform any task, and gladly."
5788,Hyah!
5789,Can't help but feel I'm a bit rusty after all that time off...
5790,This thing is heavier than it looks...
5791,Ho!
5792,This city has so many more faces I must capture on canvas...
5793,Right back in the swing of things─just as I like to see it.
5794,Have you ever lifted a pickaxe in your life?
5795,"Good to be back on the job, Chief!"
5796,I fear this is my first foray into manual labor...
5797,Let an expert show you how it's done!
5798,"I thank you for your wisdom, my friend."
5799,"You have potential, I'll say that much."
5800,Have to provide a good example for the newcomers!
5801,"Yes, it's coming back to me now! It's all in the hips..."
5802,Eyaaahhh!
5803,"It's as hard as a... Well, I guess it is a rock."
5804,All right! Which one of you dumped this rubbish here!?
5805,"Now, now... Let's take a deep breath..."
5806,How am I supposed to read these chocobo scratches!?
5807,"Are you not, perchance, holding that backwards?"
5808,Sixteen? Are you sure it wasn't eighteen?
5809,"When in doubt, it never hurts to consult the skybuilders' board."
5810,This is a vital task! Our inventory's not going to count itself.
5811,Hey you! Up there! Don't forget to show the rookies how it's done!
5812,"Keeping inventory may not be a glamorous task, but it's a necessary one."
5813,"Leave it to me, Chief!"
5814,"Consider it done, milo─er, Lord Chief."
5815,"We've got materials in spades, but we could use a few more hands."
5816,Just leave it to me.
5817,Let's see what else needs doing...
5818,I'll prepare it at once!
5819,I'd best place a new order before we run out of supplies...
5820,"Report to me as soon as your task is done, you hear?"
5821,"Got it, Miss!"
5822,How many times must I tell you to keep your eye on the nail!?
5823,Must keep focus... Must keep focus...
5824,Allow me to show you how it's─owww!
5825,"Oh, dear... That couldn't have felt good..."
5826,"A tappity-tap here, a tappity-tap there..."
5827,Am I doing this right?
5828,Looking good! Keep it up!
5829,I don't want to see a single bent nail! Understood?
5830,"How's this, Chief?"
5831,"Looking rather sharp, if I do say so myself! Haha!"
5832,"Consider it done, Lord─er, Chief."
5833,"The masses may not appreciate it, but this will be my greatest masterpiece yet!"
5834,"Numbers aren't your strong suit, are they?"
5835,Better safe than sorry...
5836,"Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-four... Wait, where was I again?"
5837,"Pray forgive my impropriety, but mayhap you forgot seventy-three...?"
5838,Sounds good to me!
5839,"We have enough supplies here, yes?"
5840,Shall I bring more from our reserves?
5841,Always good to see my skybuilders get into their work!
5842,Don't forget to rest up from time to time. We've a long way to go.
5843,"I learned it all from you, Chief!"
5844,Now <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> a generous donation! We'll put it to good use!
5845,"You are far too kind, Chief..."
5846,"I said, watch out!"
5847,Have to set a good example for the newcomers...!
5848,"It's all in the─ow! Okay, now that was an example of what <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to do."
5849,Shall I summon a healer?
5850,"At this rate, I'm going to run out of nails..."
5851,"One task done, now it's on to the next..."
5852,"Your technique's improved, I see."
5853,I reckon you're a natural at this.
5854,"Tap, tap, tappity-tap!"
5855,This may very well be my best work yet!
5856,"You flatter me overmuch, Chief..."
5857,Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look─damn it all!
5858,"Just like that, now. Take it nice and easy."
5859,"Truth be told, I enjoy working in silence."
5860,You'll want to climb up to make sure everything is in place.
5861,I can see I still have much to learn from my seniors...
5862,Now you're talking. I'm famished!
5863,Shall we take a short respite?
5864,Your stamina has improved greatly. Consider me impressed.
5865,Always remember: endurance is as important as technique─if not more so.
5866,"Thanks, Chief! I've trained hard for this day!"
5867,I'd best take another look at the plans...
5868,"Endurance indeed. I thank you for your wisdom, Chief."
5869,"Be careful now, will you!?"
5870,I've never seen wood of such quality!
5871,"I've got it down this time, I swear. Just watch me n─owww!"
5872,How did I know that was going to happen...?
5873,Bam! Bam! Bam!
5874,I wouldn't mind living in a house like this myself!
5875,"Keep it up, and you'll need my supervision no longer."
5876,"Don't get ahead of yourself, now. One nail at a time."
5877,"Heh! I could never have done it without you, Chief!"
5878,Could it be? Are we ahead of schedule?
5879,"I will endeavor to do just that, milo─er, Chief."
5880,"Develop an eye for quality materials, and it will serve you well."
5881,"Just need to smooth and polish, now..."
5882,"I've developed quite the discerning eye, if I do say so myself..."
5883,Do we have all we need?
5884,"'Tis an honor to serve, Chief."
5885,"You've quite an aptitude for art, I'd say."
5886,I reckon I'm even more talented with a chisel than with a hammer!
5887,"I mean not to boast, but I have trained some in artistic pursuits."
5888,Consider it done!
5889,Here it is! You know where it all goes. Thank you kindly!
5890,Well? What do you think?
5891,Remember: the final inspection's nigh as important as the job itself.
5892,This won't hold in its current state. Better to reinforce it further.
5893,Not a crack or blemish to speak of!
5894,"That should do it! Now, to take one final look..."
5895,"As you command, Chief."
5896,"You require a demonstration, you say? Very well, then..."
5897,The key is to put your whole body into it. Now behold! Hyaaaaaaaaah!
5898,You'll get the hang of it in no time.
5899,What in the hells is this made of? My axe's scarcely even scratching it!
5900,"If only the chief would give me a private lesson, too..."
5901,Such power!
5902,The student has become a teacher. What a marvelous sight!
5903,This task is mine─and mine alone!
5904,"It's all in the hips, you see?"
5905,'Tis not nearly so simple as it looks. Your wisdom is invaluable.
5906,How did it go again? The chief makes it look so easy...
5907,For the Firmament! For the chief! For our future!
5908,"You've come a long way, haven't you?"
5909,She'll notice me sooner or later─I just know it!
5910,That's the way!
5911,He-YAH!
5912,Is my work satisfactory?
5913,Mark my words: you will break before me. Hah!
5914,Ngggh... Yah!
5915,"To think the reconstruction effort is almost at an end... Such a bittersweet feeling, it is."
5916,"Well, look who's showing the rookies the ropes now!"
5917,I still remember the day he first joined up. He's like a whole new man!
5918,Worry not─I'll show you how it's done!
5919,"You are truly a generous teacher, my friend."
5920,"Don't overdo it. Injure yourself, and you'll be no use to anyone."
5921,You've got a knack for numbers. We've sorely needed someone like you.
5922,"This is quality stone, Chief! I can vouch for it!"
5923,I can't shake the feeling that we're running low...
5924,"I've done the calculations, and I do believe we have sufficient quantities of everything."
5925,I just finished my count─I guarantee you I overlooked nothing!
5926,"Thanks to you, I've neither a dearth nor a surplus of supplies!"
5927,That's the last task on my list. I'd best check back at the skybuilders' board.
5928,Aha...duly noted.
5929,Everything seems to be in good order here.
5930,"Yes, <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>! <Emphasis>This</Emphasis> shall be my magnum opus!"
5931,Oho! I can scarcely wait to see the finished work!
5932,Is there no limit to this man's talent and passion!?
5933,"Why, it is as if the city comes to life on his canvas!"
5934,Are my eyes to be believed?
5935,"Practice makes perfect, after all!"
5936,My fingers don't sting for once! Amazing!
5937,Pray teach me to wield the hammer with such skill.
5938,Excellent. Make sure to teach the others.
5939,"Looking good. Carry on, carry on..."
5940,Precision and speed. Both are essential...
5941,Where'd the chief go...?
5942,"Might I trouble you to inspect my work, Chief?"
5943,Hyah! Hyah!
5944,But of course! I'll be finished here any moment...
5945,We have another task for you...
5946,Look at how he's grown...
5947,Generous souls went out of their way to gather these materials for us. We must make the most of them.
5948,"Remember, quantity means nothing without quality!"
5949,I am indebted to you for your wisdom.
5950,I can scarce feel my hands!
5951,"Have we finished, then...?"
5952,She's twitching... Is that normal?
5953,Nothing quite like a kiln-fresh familiar.
5954,I never knew familiar-creation could be so rough...
5955,Do you reckon these are dry yet?
5956,"Welcome to the Firmament, my dear madam! What brings you to these heavenly environs today?"
5957,I make for the Abacus. They say some most exquisite silks from the Far East have arrived!
5958,How splendid! Might I have the honor of escorting you there?
5959,"You are far too kind, my good ser. 'Twould be a pleasure."
5960,Fine furs and hides to shelter your skin from the bitter cold!
5961,Have anythin' what needs fixin'? I'm your man!
5962,I've never seen anything quite like it...
5963,"Say no more, my good man! I have everything you need..."
5964,Do you perchance have needles and thread in supply? I mean to learn weaving...
5965,"Mayhap I, too, will write my memoirs one day..."
5966,Ow! I want to find whoever dropped that kupo nut on the street and slap them silly!
5967,To soak a bit longer or head for the steam baths? <Emphasis>That</Emphasis> is the question...
5968,What a breathtaking sight...!
5969,
5970,A studio befitting my prodigious talents!
5971,My masterpieces will surely fetch good coin in Featherfall...
5972,I will stop at nothing to see the Firmament safe for residents and visitors alike!
5973,"All right, time to make the rounds again..."
5974,This is our new home! Isn't it lovely?
5975,How warm and toasty it must be inside!
5976,How long does she mean to keep me waiting...?
5977,I bought some fine wine from a distant land. What say we raise a toast?
5978,"Beg pardon, but what are you doing in front of our house?"
5979,"Finally, my dear sister and I have a home of our own!"
5980,Let's go inside. We'll catch our death of cold out here.
5981,"The child will meet us here, they say?"
5982,So I was told. Let us give her the warmest of welcomes.
5983,"W-Welcome, child─er, my daughter."
5984,"Forgive your father, my dear. He can be terribly stiff on these occasions."
5985,Father! Mother! How happy I am to be part of your family!
5986,"Well, doesn't your coat look so warm and toasty!"
5987,Baaaaaa! Baaaaaa!
5988,And what a fine nest this is!
5989,"Thanks to Ehll Tou, we're now allowed to live here, too!"
5990,My back aches just looking at her...
5991,It's all in the hips!
5992,"Well, look who's come to visit!"
5993,"Might I join you, kupo?"
5994,'Tis my duty to see that all the instruments are tuned to perfection.
5995,What a magnificent structure! Whatever do you suppose it's for?
5996,They say it's to serve as lodgings for luminaries and guests of honor.
5997,No entry allowed. The interior is still undergoing renovations.
5998,But that's all the coin I have...
5999,"The other vendors may not be open for business yet, but we certainly are!"
6000,How far this place has come...
6001,"So these are our new barracks, eh?"
6002,We'll need to ensure they're properly outfitted...
6003,Just look at this place! When are we moving in?
6004,"Grow strong, my seedlings..."
6005,Headed to the Pillars? They're just beyond here.
6006,Ahhh! Who needs a waterfall when we have this right here in town?
6007,When will they let us in to play?
6008,Baaaaaa!
6009,Poor thing! Are you lost?
6010,"Where, oh where did my dear little Dolly run off to!?"
6011,The owner of this home is a stickler for detail. I don't want to see a single nail out of place!
6012,"Oh, thank you for lighting my lovelies. Did they not shine so beautifully in the sky?"
6013,Captain... Pray let me retire while my limbs are still intact...
6014,Oh! I know the perfect lullaby!
6015,Whatever must I do to get you to close your eyes...?
6016,Let's take it to old Marcelloix's shop. There's nothing he can't fix.
6017,"It's broken! Whatever can I do, Grandpa?"
6018,I...I'm f-fine! Honest!
6019,Worry not! I'll catch you!
6020,"Next, it's my time to shine!"
6021,"Ah, nothing like a dance to forget one's worries!"
6022,They'll never think to look for me here...
6023,Looks like it wasn't such a good hiding place after all...
6024,And now you're on our side. Let's look for the other two!
6025,Haha! Found you!
6026,Ungh...
6027,Only healers and staff are permitted on the upper levels.
6028,Nothing I can't bear. I will be out of this place in no time.
6029,"Does it hurt, my dear?"
6030,What I wouldn't give to walk the streets again...
6031,Now where did I leave that phial?
6032,Did you sleep well?
6033,But I'm glad you didn't keep me waiting here too long!
6034,"All looks in order, you say? Splendid!"
6035,Hah! That's what I like to see.
6036,"Not a scratch on it, Chief!"
6037,"No issues in terms of quantity or quality, milord."
6038,How do our stores hold up?
6039,Have you any tasks for me?
6040,Have I ever! Where to begin...?
6041,"Fine, ignore me like that! I'll show them I can do the work as well as anyone."
6042,No rest for the weary...
6043,This is taking its toll on my back...
6044,Indeed...
6045,This one's a quick learner...
6046,"Rest is important, too! Even the chief says so!"
6047,That's not fair! You're better at this than me!
6048,I do believe I've got the knack of this...
6049,You've grown into a fine craftsman!
6050,"You've got skill, that much is certain."
6051,"How does it look, Chief?"
6052,"I'm working hard, too, Chief! Look at me!"
6053,"Fingers out of the way... Steady, now..."
6054,If I had two hammers...♪
6055,Not a single nail sticking out─superb!
6056,All tasks are proceeding apace!
6057,How do we fare?
6058,"I'm working hard, I promise!"
6059,No delays─that's what I like to see.
6060,Concentrate...concentrate...
6061,<sniffle> How they've grown...
6062,Would be nice to walk these streets together when our work is done...
6063,"Soon, we'll be going our separate ways..."
6064,That's the way!
6065,I'm taking a nice hot bath soon as my work is done.
6066,"Yes, this should more than suffice."
6067,I said <Emphasis>don't</Emphasis> look down!
6068,The end is in sight! No slacking off till the job is done!
6069,Fascinating...
6070,Where do you suppose the chief will go when the work is done...?
6071,'Twould be my pleasure.
6072,"Why, yes...all appears to be in good order."
6073,The chief says not a single spot is to be overlooked.
6074,"Oh, thank the heavens! I knew I could count on you!"
6075,Why does no one come to my aid!? Can they not see the pain I'm in!?
6076,"Do not abandon me so! Oh, how I suffer!"
6077,You again. What is it this time?
6078,"This goes here, and─yes, that should be right."
6079,We could have used one of these earlier.
6080,Now for the finishing touch!
6081,"Soon, they shall all be connected..."
6082,"They're convenient enough to use, but a real hassle to carry..."
6083,Where does this go again?
6084,"I've been working as hard as anyone! Harder, even! The hardest!"
6085,It is hard to believe our work is almost done...
6086,"Truly, this is my greatest work yet!"
6087,Yes! My muse speaks to me!
6088,You have done well to come this far!
6089,"Thanks to you, Lord Francel's vision for the Firmament is realized at last!"
6090,You should be proud of yourselves today. Hold your heads high!
6091,I have no words...
6092,Huzzah! Huzzah!
6093,"My muscles throb, but my spirit sings!"
6094,This should loosen you up...
6095,A little lower─ahhh! That hits the spot!
6096,Ahhh! This is the life...
6097,"Brrrrrr! The Fury take me, it's freezing!"
6098,"Hot, then cold, then hot, then cold. Nothing better for the body..."
6099,I'll last longer than yesterday. Just you watch...
6100,We'll be open for business shortly.
6101,I can feel all my aches and worries melting away...
6102,Ahhh... Simply heavenly...
6103,Nothin' like a flagon of Ishgard's finest after a soak in the springs!
6104,These ruins seem to stretch on forever...
6105,"My, what a fascinating magick construct."
6106,"When you are ready, we can begin our search for Misija."
6107,"Please be careful, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
6108,Imperials!
6109,All right. I'm ready.
6110,
6111,
6112,
6113,
6114,
6115,
6116,
6117,
6118,
6119,
6120,
6121,
6122,
6123,
6124,"Save some for me, kupo!"
6125,"This cookie's mine, kupo!"
6126,The walking ones have such exciting festivals!
6127,This one loves to frolic and play!
6128,"Tee hee!
These eggs are perfect for hiding in!"
6129,"Such a heavenly smell, kupo!"
6130,"Keep those cookies coming, kupo!"
6131,"<belch> Oh!
Excuse me, kupo!"
6132,"Hopefully, Tiamat's wounds are not too severe..."
6133,Our efforts may have helped Arenvald and Fordola escape...
6134,Is that the last we've seen of Bahamut?
6135,The Amalj'aa will not soon forget this day...
6136,"Our allies have steered well clear of the tower, for good reason."
6137,Those kobolds certainly know how to handle themselves!
6138,"Isn't it beautiful, T'kebbe? I wish I knew the story behind how it was made..."
6139,I bet it's even yummier than it is pretty!
6140,What a lovely dessert! I wonder if there's pineapple in it...
6141,"Today, my dear girls, you feast on frosty goodness!"
6142,"Gods, why does the sun have to be so strong? Ungh..."
6143,Lord Emmanellain! Perhaps we should move to the shade...
6144,!!!
6145,...
6146,You're gonna eat <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>?
6147,The might of our muscles...
6148,...will blast away the Bombard menace!
6149,Bam! Bam!
6150,Here's hoping we don't see any more near-drownings...
6151,What a frightening sight that was!
6152,I'm just glad the poor girl is safe...
6153,Talk about a tasty and refreshing treat!
6154,"So crisp on the outside, and fluffy within!"
6155,"Why, it absolutely melts in your mouth!"
6156,What is this flush I feel all of a sudden...?
6157,What is this chill that goes down my spine? Has that icy fiend returned...?
6158,"Oh, sweet and frosty succor of the gods! I'm practically melting in here..."
6159,C-Captain! Before you eat that...
6160,We may have gone a little too far...
6161,Nonsense! We deserve a respite for once.
6162,Kweh!
6163,"Nay, we cannot forget the past...but neither should we be bound by it."
6164,"Aye, we forge on.
Here's to new paths!"
6165,I'm planning to find work in Werlyt.
6166,But there's still plenty that needs doing here...
6167,I can't remember the last time the sea was this calm...
6168,Greetings and welcome to the Firmament!
6169,What a jolly dance!
6170,"Isn't it, though?"
6171,"Come for the fun, stay for the food!"
6172,"Mmmmmm, festival food..."
6173,Join us in the Skyrise Celebration!
6174,I do like me a good celebration...
6175,They love me! Everyone loves me! <sob>
6176,Whoa! How does he do that?
6177,Hurts my fingers just to look at it...
6178,Why meeeeee...!?
6179,"Get a hold of yourself, already!"
6180,There's something for everyone!
6181,The children are going to love this!
6182,"We source only the finest, freshest Coerthan fruits."
6183,"Oh, Sister! Don't they look delicious?"
6184,"Lycelle and the others would just love it, I'm sure!"
6185,I didn't know there were so many varieties of apples...
6186,Sweets for the sweet?
6187,"Oh, it's so hard to choose!"
6188,There's only one solution: try everything!
6189,"Take that, you adulterous scoundrel!"
6190,She's yet to miss!
6191,"I'm with you, sister!"
6192,"I don't know much about foreign dances, but I know what I like!"
6193,I want one of those costumes.
6194,"Mmmmmm, simple pleasures..."
6195,"Mmmmmm, decadent delicacies..."
6196,There's a festival going on!
6197,"Come on, let's check it out!"
6198,"Ooh, sounds like fun!"
6199,Yeah!
6200,Meow! Meow!
6201,Purrr...
6202,Meow?
6203,Meow.♪
6204,How thoughtful of them to build a workshop for artists like myself...
6205,Shall I fashion a few ornaments to brighten the place up?
6206,This stained crystal was inspired by your masterpieces...
6207,I wonder how the chief is faring these days...?
6208,"I miss her, too, but we've a job to do here."
6209,"Well, look who's here. Working hard as ever, I would hope?"
6210,Chief! You remembered us!
6211,"Keep up the effort, and one day you'll be master builders yourselves!"
6212,Chief! Chiiieeef! We missed you so!
6213,I hear the new public bathhouse is open for business.
6214,"Bathhouse, you say? I could use a soak to warm these bones!"
6215,Who'd have thought these streets would ever shine like this?
6216,It's all thanks to those skybuilders!
6217,"Your hammer served us well, eh?"
6218,Of course it did! You expected any less?
6219,The hero of Ishgard? Here? Why didn't you say so sooner!?
6220,You'll never guess who they say paid a visit here to the Firmament!
6221,Now I'm working up a sweat!
6222,<sniff> Urk─you're telling me...
6223,"Gah, I can't decide..."
6224,One of us! One of us!
6225,"Where's the lucky toy hidden?
Wouldn't you like to know!"
6226,Take it to Perky Piggy!
6227,These presents are for artisans.
6228,Off you go and give it to an artisan.
6229,These presents are for merchants.
6230,Please give it to a merchant.
6231,This little lot here is for children.
6232,Go on and give it to a child.
6233,"Work that needle! Aye, work it!"
6234,Remember to lift with your knees!
6235,Hurry and take it to the central plaza!
6236,I've never seen so many stuffed toys in one place!
6237,More! We need more stuffed toys!
6238,Make as many as you can!
6239,Won't you join in the revelry?
6240,"Big fellows, these wooly yaks..."
6241,Down on the poultry farm.♪
6242,"No pecking now, there's a good chicken."
6243,Any eggs today?
6244,Should probably look busy...
6245,"We'll just tidy up a bit here, shall we?"
6246,I thought we'd never see the ocean again!
6247,I suppose not <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> grown-ups are scary...
6248,"Oh gods, nearly slipped there!"
6249,It's nice to see everyone happy and playing again!
6250,They'll never find me here!
6251,I was <Emphasis>so</Emphasis> sure this was the best hiding place!
6252,She's with Father.
6253,I told her to stay with him.
6254,"She can come and play with us later.
Much later..."
6255,Found you!
6256,Then we'll carry on playing with just the four of us!
6257,Where would we be without our big brother?
6258,We knew we'd find you in the end.
6259,"Even when we're apart, we'll always be together."
6260,She's the youngest...but maybe the cleverest.
6261,She's the only one left.
6262,Here─I've brought your jacket.
6263,"Well, then. Shall we go enjoy the festivities?"
6264,"Why, thank you!"
6265,Give it your best!
6266,The stuffed toys go here.
6267,"Keep it steady, now..."
6268,Go on and give the yak a good shearing!
6269,"Ugh, my nose itches something fierce..."
6270,I want to shoot too...
6271,"No present boxes beyond here, I assure you!"
6272,You'll want to keep to this area.
6273,"You won't find anything this way, oh no."
6274,Help is here!
6275,"This way, allies, comrades, friends!"
6276,"Be careful, vigilant, watchful!"
6277,Remember to take stock at the end of each day.
6278,I-Incredible...
6279,Is that the Azure Dragoon?
6280,To think a dragon would come to our aid...
6281,Such strength...
6282,"You can do it, Brother!"
6283,"Go boom, boom, my beauties!"
6284,Now <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> is what I call a battle!
6285,Our heroes!
6286,Let those blasted Bombards have it!
6287,Those fiends are no match for you!
6288,Ah... Aaah...
6289,For...Garlemald...
6290,Ungh...
6291,"We need a healer, quickly!"
6292,"Hold still, this will only take a moment!"
6293,Fine! I can...stop yelling...hrrrgh...
6294,Can we go home now?
6295,As long as we get the brewery running again...
6296,What is this “cooperation” you speak of?
6297,"I ain't responsible, that's for sure."
6298,Are you versed in moral epistemology? I have questions.
6299,Threat suppressed.
6300,"Join us, friend!"
6301,"Come play, come play!"
6302,Uwaaah!
6303,"Hehe, let's see if you can find it..."
6304,"Take it to Perky Piggy, now."
6305,Won't you play too? 
6306,O-Oh dear...
6307,B-Best of luck...
6308,P-Perky Piggy awaits...
6309,C-Come play with us...
6310,Take the toy to Perky Piggy!
6311,Off to Perky Piggy with you!
6312,Hurry back to Perky Piggy!
6313,Won't you join in the revelry?
6314,Why aren't you taking part?
6315,Please join the fun!
6316,Why not stay and play awhile?
6317,Mighty Moogle is calling!
6318,Chirpy Chocobo is calling!
6319,Perky Piggy is calling!
6320,Why aren't you taking part?
6321,Please join the fun!
6322,"Join us, friend!"
6323,Wait for meee!
6324,"Keep running, we're almost there!"
6325,"Celebrate good times, come on!"
6326,Are we all here?
6327,What a crowd!
6328,Huzzah!
6329,My body is ready!
6330,How exciting!
6331,"<wheeze> Ugh, I've got a stitch..."
6332,I've been looking forward to this!
6333,"Let rip with the aetheromatic clipper, kupo!"
6334,"Chirpy Chocobo is a real fleece fiend, if you know what I mean."
6335,We must do all we can to aid the Bozjans.
6336,Hyaaah!
6337,Here's what we know so far...
6338,"All right lads, listen carefully..."
6339,"It's the Eastern alliance, thank the gods! ...Or the kami! Whichever you prefer."
6340,There's something<Emphasis> off</Emphasis> about that Garlean fleet...
6341,We won't be dying today.
6342,
6343,
6344,
6345,
6346,
6347,
6348,
6349,
6350,
6351,
6352,"Off we go, then!"
6353,"Now we run.
Try to keep up!"
6354,Up here.
6355,"The Rostra...
Not far now."
6356,Over this way!
6357,"Ungh... Someone, help..."
6358,Follow my lead!
6359,She's fond of perusing the stalls here.
6360,"Hmm... If she's not here, where could she be?"
6361,In one of these pots? Perhaps not...
6362,I've never known her to be <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> elusive.
6363,This way!
6364,Help...
6365,So cold...
6366,Why me?
6367,Take me home...
6368,I do so enjoy receiving letters.
6369,I know!
6370,Thank heavens for good news.
6371,What a delightful gift!
6372,I thought you'd like it.
6373,These festivities certainly are...festive.
6374,<squeal> <squeal>
6375,"Now, which fish shall I look at next...?"
6376,"Busy, busy, busy."
6377,It's so hot... Can't breathe...
6378,"Please, no! You must hold on!"
6379,The plague will consume us all!
6380,I... I need...water...
6381,I can't take it anymore...
6382,Phew. Time for a break.
6383,Make way! Coming through!
6384,"Oh me, oh my, look at the time!"
6385,"I'm late! For a very important...
appointment!"
6386,All right! On to the next one!
6387,"So much to do, so little time!"
6388,Wait... Where was I supposed to go again?
6389,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Is aught the matter?"
6390,Hm...?
6391,Please...don't leave me to die here.
6392,Who's there...?
6393,At last our time is come. Mercy for us all.
6394,Ra-la shall set all to rights.
6395,"Ra-la, I beseech you─free me from this mortal coil!"
6396,Ra-la...?
6397,We're going through whether you like it or not!
6398,Stop wasting time!
6399,That seems to have been the limit of the tower's defenses.
6400,"From what I can tell, the summonings appear to be over."
6401,No belief is sacred to these Telophoroi...
6402,"They were nimble fighters, I'll give them that."
6403,"The embodiment of Garlemald's hopes and dreams, eh?"
6404,No one would wish for such an abomination...
6405,What doth lie within these countless vials?
6406,Where are Zenos and Fandaniel!?
6407,How could love for one's nation give rise to such a monstrosity?
6408,Agony made flesh...
6409,The orchestrators of this chaos are nowhere to be seen.
6410,"That was the worst of them...or at least, I <Emphasis>hope</Emphasis> it was."
6411,I see no trace of the person it once was.
6412,The horrors of Amaurot born anew...
6413,...
6414,Vrtra is close... Still fighting in the skies above.
6415,This must be the blasphemy they spoke of...
6416,Let us leave the rest to Emet-Selch.
6417,A merry chase he led us on.
6418,Hopefully he has calmed down a little...
6419,Some things can't be washed away.
6420,Ysayle...
6421,I sense yet a presence...
6422,He's not gone!
6423,This is becoming tiresome.
6424,Such was the strength of her faith in us.
6425,"Life is a struggle, but its worth is no lie!"
6426,I never thought we'd end up fighting Hydaelyn Herself...
6427,I trust you're still in one piece?
6428,'Twould appear we have proven equal to the challenge.
6429,I hope that'll suffice!
6430,And so it ends...
6431,All in a day's work...
6432,A battle that would go down in history...were there anyone but us to tell the tale.
6433,At least now we have an idea of what drives her.
6434,I shudder to think how many more worlds she watched fall.
6435,A great dread nigh beyond description yet hangeth on the air.
6436,"However deep the despair, we cannot give up!"
6437,"They attained paradise, and yet it proved their unmaking... Not at all what I expected."
6438,I am no stranger to despair. I would not be here with you otherwise.
6439,A calamity of disease or war I can understand. But paradise?
6440,Yaaay!
6441,You can do it!
6442,Run! Faster!
6443,Stay strong! Every life we save matters!
6444,Gracious Mrga...grant your strength to the Radiant Host!
6445,Yes! We must save all we can!
6446,Why...!? The horror!
6447,Urgh...
6448,<pant> <wheeze> 
6449,Am I... Am I alive...?
6450,I don't want to die! Not here! Not like this!
6451,"By the gods, say something! Please!"
6452,No... Gods have mercy!
6453,Such power! I can scarcely believe it!
6454,Hssssss!
6455,Gah... Hah...
6456,"O Ra-la, bringer of sweet oblivion! Hear our prayers!"
6457,"Please, O merciful Ra-la! Free us from the shackles of mortality!"
6458,Only in death may we find peace!
6459,From nothing we were born! To nothing must we return!
6460,"On golden wings, it comes. Sweet oblivion!"
6461,By golden wings shall we know our end!
6462,Readying aether. Please stand back.
6463,"Ready to discharge. Test subjects, please gather near."
6464,Caw! Caw!
6465,"Ah, so that's how it's done..."
6466,We succeeded!
6467,"We've won, but the question remains..."
6468,Whence did this hellscape arise?
6469,We only need seal him away.
6470,Hesperos... Why?
6471,<pant> <pant>
6472,Who are you!? Stay away!
6473,"When's the
walk-off?"
6474,Looking good!
6475,"<gasp> Is that
the Songbirds?"
6476,I can't wait!
6477,Such style!
6478,"Oh, how cute!"
6479,"Start the
show already!"
6480,"Ulala!
I love you!"
6481,"It feels like
it's been ages... "
6482,"Masha!
Marry me!"
6483,"You're gorgeous,
Narumi!"
6484,"I'd like to try
wearing that myself!"
6485,Yaaay!
6486,"Oh, yeah!"
6487,Wahoo!
6488,"Enjoy the show,
everyone!"
6489,"See you again
soon!"
6490,"We missed
you all!"
6491,"Farewell
for now!"
6492,"Did you
miss us?"
6493,Bye now!
6494,Caw! Caw!
6495,Waaak! Waaak!
6496,Coo... Coo...
6497,"Looks like they're ready.
All right, here I go!"
6498,Haaah!
6499,Just warming up!
6500,
6501,It's pleasant here amongst the trees...
6502,But we really should move along.
6503,"Keep to the path.
Straight ahead!"
6504,We cross this bridge.
6505,Quick and quiet as a mouse...
6506,Is s-someone there?
6507,Y-You won't catch me!
6508,Gwaaargh...
6509,Look! It's snowing!
6510,"Oh, how beautiful!"
6511,You two aren't cold?
6512,"Come forth, you curious beast! Heh heh heh..."
6513,I'm the most beautiful of them all!
6514,Kweh!
6515,
6516,"Now shall we─ Oh godsdammit, not again..."
6517,It's this way!
6518,What if she's been abducted!?
6519,"Shhh! Step softly, will you? You will wake them."
6520,Neigh...!
6521,Hurry now! Time is of the essence!
6522,"To the next job, quickly now!"
6523,We've work over here to be getting on with!
6524,"This next tune-up ought to be our last, I dare say!"
6525,"Pick up the pace, everyone!"
6526,We're certainly on the move now!
6527,"Whistle while you work, friends!"
6528,"Nearly done now, everyone!"
6529,"Do slow down, won't you? I-I can't keep up!"
6530,"W-Wait for me, I beg you!"
6531,"O-Oh dear... My legs, they're so stiff!"
6532,I...I can't go on. Leave me... 
6533,This new armor is so heavy I can barely move a muscle...
6534,"If you had muscles to move, you wouldn't be whinging like that."
6535,This thesis is most intriguing. We ought to bring this up with the Forum. 
6536,Do me a favor and gather all the information you can about the author.
6537,"As YoU wIsH, iT sHaLl Be DoNe."
6538,"Hey, I was looking all over for you two!"
6539,"At this rate, these flowers will wilt before the customer picks them up..."
6540,Hm... It would seem the old methods are simply not productive anymore.
6541,"I'm simply famished, yet I can't decide what I'd like to eat!"
6542,I'm looking for materials on the Calamity of Fire... Do you know of any offhand?
6543,Is this it? Damn it all... I'm having a devil of a time finding that tome.
6544,"I shouldn't spend my research grant on personal items, but...maybe just this once? "
6545,Nothing beats a fresh brew from the Last Stand!
6546,I hereby swear: I shall become an Archon if it's the last thing I do!
6547,Is this all the cargo? I should triple-check...
6548,"Mom said we'd head home half an hour ago, but they keep talking..."
6549,That tome... Could it be...?
6550,How do we feel about the Forum's actions as of late?
6551,Permit me to share my thoughts about today's lecture. You see... 
6552,"The ship should be arriving soon, but I don't see anything in the offing..."
6553,See here? This cannot be right. We'll have to start again.
6554,Let's see... Is this everything to be transported to Labyrinthos?
6555,You seem a bit burdened with work. Shall I lend you a hand?
6556,Did you hear about the consortium?
6557,May these days of ease and comfort last forevermore... 
6558,"All done with your shopping, I hope? Or do you have to run back <Emphasis>again</Emphasis>?"
6559,"Have a care and take a step back, would you? I won't have you distracting me."
6560,"Welcome, travelers, to the vibrant city of Radz–at–Han!"
6561,"Let's see, what would keep the senses sharp even in the small hours?"
6562,Seems we need more medicines and philters.
6563,"So, the thing about a good merchant is... "
6564,Never do I feel more myself than when I watch a performance.
6565,How fare the markets of late?
6566,Do you not see it? We will never again have such an opportunity for expansion!
6567,"All you could possibly want, we have for you right here! And at the best prices, no less!"
6568,"I've seen naught better, 'tis true, but my coinpurse is rather...light these days."
6569,These colors are truly exquisite. So vibrant!
6570,"One final touch remains, and then I shall be finished."
6571,"The soil is good, the water is clear─I could not ask for better conditions."
6572,"No, I'm good this ti─oh, wait! There's one more thing. But I promise this is it!"
6573,"Goodness me, where to start?"
6574,"And all this is meant for...ah yes, Sharlayan Hamlet."
6575,"These conditions are excellent, so they should keep a great while."
6576,"Gesticulate at me all you like, but that specimen is in need of another test."
6577,"Why, just look at them. They'll grow up big and strong soon enough!"
6578,"One must always be learning, even during periods of rest."
6579,"You call these documents research?
They're not even worth wiping the privy floor with!"
6580,I've not heard a thing about when the blasted research is due! You?
6581,"All appears very much in order here, I would say."
6582,"Check it again, would you? We cannot be too careful. "
6583,Could we not expand the markets? Open a few new shops?
6584,Gently... Gently now... Remember what happened last time.
6585,I must remain calm. I must find my inner peace. Breathe in... Breathe out.
6586,I will hone both my mind and my body into the satrap's sharpest blade!
6587,Am I ever glad to be stationed so close to a campfire!
6588,"This is perilous terrain, you hear me? Keep your guard up at all times!"
6589,"What wretched weather to be laboring in.
As if this work weren't hard enough!"
6590,You there! Empty your satchel right now!
6591,"If any of these get too damp,
it could spell trouble for us."
6592,It...hurts... 
6593,"Why did I live,
when so many others...?"
6594,"The air is ice itself.
I may freeze to death at this rate."
6595,<sniffle> I-I'm hungry...!
6596,Damn it all...! Is there truly nothing to be done!?
6597,"M-My wife, my daughter, too... Th-They both... "
6598,Processing power: optimal. Overall status: fantastic!
6599,"Listen, everyone, or you'll miss your next assignments!"
6600,"Oh goodness me, what was I told to do again?"
6601,"Suppose this needs an overhaul, now they've changed specifications on us."
6602,"Th-This is much taller than I initially thought. Oh dear, I feel dizzy."
6603,"Well, this will all need to be redone, I imagine."
6604,"There must be something to be done about this. Come now, think, think, think... "
6605,High time we got serious─put our backs into it!
6606,I...just can't seem to...<yawn> stop nodding off... 
6607,Nothing for it. Only one thing to be done─scrap it all and start over!
6608,"Work harder, I say! No, no─<Emphasis>harder</Emphasis>! Don't make me come down there!"
6609,"We finish this today, understand? So hop to it!"
6610,"Sir, yes, sir!"
6611,"Aw, there's a good plant. Grow up nice and strong for me, all right?"
6612,"Yes, this will serve us just fine, I should think!"
6613,"These really are stunning. Can't quite take my eyes off them, in fact."
6614,Is there anything more beautiful than watching the cycle of life at work?
6615,"Just a few samples ought to suffice, I should imagine."
6616,"Rest is vital for one's efficiency, you know?"
6617,"There, there. All is well. You've nothing to fear."
6618,This would make a fine location for the rearing of aquatic creatures.
6619,"You overexert yourself, and your health will suffer for it. Rest, I beg you."
6620,You did marvelously in your flight training today. Very well done indeed!
6621,"Given its body weight and the effort it requires to remain aloft, I would say this creature can fly for... "
6622,It is as if a thick fog has settled over my mind.
6623,"All is nothingness, forever and on... "
6624,"Ah, yes... I've hit upon a fine verse, haven't I? Heh... Heh... "
6625,Recharge required. Please leave this unit alone.
6626,Is there truly naught to be done with the silks that remain?
6627,"All this here needs to be brought straight to the piers, understood?"
6628,Hm... Perhaps a few adjustments are in order.
6629,"...Well, this stinks."
6630,Daresay we have stores enough to last us awhile. That is some comfort.
6631,"Heavens, this...is <oof> quite a task. My muscles'll be aching tomorrow!"
6632,"I've only...just...begun! Take this, rocks!"
6633,"Oh dear me, no. I'm too high up! Somebody─anybody! Get me down!"
6634,High time we built ourselves more scaffolding. That next level is looking lonely.
6635,Should you need anything─anything at all─say the word and it shall be yours.
6636,"I've many and more shipments left to place, so do return as soon as you are able."
6637,Is that the last of the cargo?
6638,Hm... Doesn't look like the next vessel will be arriving any time soon...
6639,Fascinating! You simply <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> tell me more about your research.
6640,The cargo list was already submitted. Let me check the registry...
6641,Perhaps I'll buy a new tome to accompany me on my journey.
6642,Have you visited that shop over there? The owner certainly has the gift of the gab!
6643,I could use a drink or three... Somethin' to take the edge off.
6644,I'm pleased our paths could cross once more.
6645,Looking forward to serving you again soon!
6646,Careful there! What you carry is incredibly fragile.
6647,The numbers you gave me aren't adding up. Are you sure you counted correctly?
6648,"If you spot any nasty-looking vilekin, come straight to me, understand?"
6649,"All right, I'd say I've earned myself a quick rest!"
6650,"...You aren't looking for help with another experiment, are you?"
6651,Is...there...no end?
6652,"I, er...just remembered that I'm terribly busy. Farewell! "
6653,Do be sure to procure more of the material we discussed.
6654,Those berries are the most tastyfresh gobbietreats!
6655,"I've never seen them before... They aren't dangerous, are they?"
6656,Not at all! Very safe! Safe for uplanders to yummyeat!
6657,Gobbies never lie. So let us sell our goodygoods!
6658,"Well, don't these look delicious? My, my, that color. How unique!"
6659,"They do look good, don't they? It's hard to pick just one."
6660,"They're a real treat, I assure you. Buy one─your palate'll thank you for it!"
6661,I'm famished. Shall we grab a bite to eat?
6662,"Yes, let's. At the cafeteria, then? I'm on a rather tight budget..."
6663,"I could smell this all day long, I could!"
6664,"Bring that to the storehouse, would you?"
6665,"Very well. The second storehouse, I presume?"
6666,
6667,Never did I think we would have the chance to speak again.
6668,Likewise. It's a miracle we are here at all.
6669,Your patronage is always appreciated. 
6670,"Why of course. You've such a fine collection of wares, how could go I to anyone else?"
6671,"I have business at Aporia, if you wouldn't mind letting me through."
6672,"Why certainly, provided you have the requisite documents."
6673,"I was asked to adjust the temperature in here. Apparently, some find it too stuffy. "
6674,"I concur. You might want to do something about the humidity, too, while you're at it."
6675,Looks like there's no more fruit fertilizer...
6676,Could you let them know for me?
6677,"Why, certainly, ribbit!"
6678,Isn't there <Emphasis>something</Emphasis> we can do to further fortify our walls?
6679,"No─at least, not without new materials, there isn't."
6680,What happened to those supplies you ordered a while back?
6681,"Come to think of it, I haven't received them yet."
6682,I ask that you divide the inspection duties amongst yourselves.
6683,I sHaLl BeGiN oVeR tHeRe.
6684,AnD i ShAlL sTaRt ThErE.
6685,"Then I'll inspect this section, ribbit!"
6686,"Is there such a thing as an end, if there is no beginning? Makes one think."
6687,"Its temperament appears to be somewhat more stable, to be sure."
6688,"I say we let it loose for a bit, see how it behaves."
6689,It appears to have moss growing on its head...
6690,Indeed. They must be living in perfect symbiosis. 
6691,"Maybe you do, too. Would explain why it's taken such a liking to you."
6692,E-Error c-c-c-code 4014. Unknown m-m-m-malfunction.
6693,Damage to system detected. Attempting to restore.
6694,"Well, here's a conundrum: which carrots should we start with?"
6695,I vote philosopher's carrots. They'll keep us light on our feet!
6696,"No, no─iron carrots first. We won't get far without bulging thews!"
6697,What food do you think mankind likes?
6698,"Oh, excellent question... "
6699,"Well, carrots, surely."
6700,"All right, this water quality won't check itself! Let's get to it."
6701,Visual inspection complete. Status: crystal clear!
6702,<slurp> Taste inspection complete. Status: delicious!
6703,<sniff> <sniff> Scent inspection complete. Status: bracing!
6704,How goes the system change?
6705,"Oh, about as well as can be expected."
6706,"Honestly, if it weren't for bad luck, we'd have no luck at all."
6707,"You mustn't worry, darling. I am sure he managed to escape, just like we did."
6708,<sniffle> Wh-Where's Daddy? D-Did he...?
6709,"Tell me, where does it hurt?"
6710,"My arm. Argh, it's killing me...!"
6711,"Oh dear. Well, that isn't good, now is it?"
6712,Help me! Aaah!
6713,And what of our stores of perishables? What shall we do with them?
6714,"Sell them, that's what. At cost, if we must."
6715,"A tad drastic, don't you think? The tavern may yet pay full price."
6716,"Here's the cargo you requested, sir."
6717,You're one shipment too early! Take it back.
6718,I'm afraid you have a bit too much cargo for me to collect...
6719,"Indeed. You go and call for help, I'll stay here and keep watch."
6720,I wonder if they've finished with the evaluation yet...
6721,What's the status of this cargo?
6722,DoCuMeNtS cUrReNtLy UnDeR rEvIeW. pLeAsE wAiT.
6723,Got any cargo for me to collect?
6724,Not yet. Come back once I've finished reviewing this load.
6725,"Ah, there you are. Do you have a moment?"
6726,"For you, madam? I've all the time in the world."
6727,"Last Stand-bound, are you? Today's brew was truly exquisite."
6728,Good to know. I will pay them a visit on my way to the Forum.
6729,BoOkShElF iNsPeCtIoN cOmPleTe. PrEsErVaTiOn StAtUs: GoOd.
6730,"We've still got enough rations, by the looks of it."
6731,"Brought you more supplies, if you've the space for it."
6732,"Ah, thank you. Let me see... Oh, terribly sorry, but this belongs over there."
6733,"Why, this might actually work."
6734,"And where am I to deliver all this to, exactly?"
6735,"Ruveydah Fibers, if you wouldn't mind?"
6736,Have anything else which needs delivering?
6737,"Is that meant in jest? Of course there is. All you see here, in fact."
6738,I've your deliveries here.
6739,"Ah, excellent. Thank you."
6740,"Point me to what next needs delivering, if you would be so kind."
6741,"Let's see... Ah yes, these here if you wouldn't mind?"
6742,"Still rifling through materials, are you?"
6743,Unfortunately... I'm struggling to find just the right tome.
6744,We'll have to replenish the feed stock...
6745,There's barely anything left!
6746,Have the goods I ordered arrived?
6747,"Not yet, I'm afraid."
6748,"How unfortunate. I'll check back later, then."
6749,Excuse me. Do you have any digestives?
6750,"We do stock them, but we just sold out. My apologies..."
6751,Spare some extra material?
6752,You're out already? <sigh> Fine─but be frugal with it.
6753,Be honest: how much of today's lecture did you understand?
6754,Honestly? Not a word.
6755,"You too, eh? Let's hope we fare better in the next one, then."
6756,Right then! I'm off to the High Crucible.
6757,"Give my regards to everyone there, won't you?"
6758,No irregularities detected.
6759,Oh... I've forgotten what I've come here to do.
6760,"It is as if my mind is drifting further and further away... Slowly, so slowly. "
6761,"And where is it you are going, pray tell?"
6762,"The Bureau of the Architect, if you must know. I've a highly original concept..."
6763,Don't you even <Emphasis>think</Emphasis> of fertilizing that!
6764,But my magnum opus!
6765,I've got the goods.
6766,No wear! Clothes itchy!
6767,Tiny hippo. ...Must protect.
6768,"Look here─just <Emphasis>try</Emphasis> wearin' some, eh?"
6769,I thought I told you to stop following me!
6770,"Over here, big fellow!"
6771,Take aim and blast this fell beast!
6772,Retreat! Every man for himself!
6773,He spoke to me! He actually spoke to me!
6774,"It's Alphinaud himself, in the flesh!"
6775,Looks clear...
6776,I can't feel my hands...
6777,Got to keep moving!
6778,I know you're up to no good!
6779,<gasp>
6780,Perhaps I lost <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>... 
6781,"This way's blocked, too?"
6782,"I'm going home, no matter what!"
6783,M-Must have been the wind.
6784,I-Is someone there?
6785,Th-This can't be... 
6786,"So far, so good..."
6787,Is someone there?
6788,I must be imagining things.
6789,Better catch my breath...
6790,"If those beasts spot me, I'm done for."
6791,I hope my luck holds...
6792,Got to keep going... They're all depending on me!
6793,Just a little farther!
6794,"This is it, the final spurt!"
6795,This way. Hurry!
6796,"Mum, I'm coming!"
6797,"Please, we have to hurry!"
6798,She's just a little further!
6799,"Over that hill, right?"
6800,This must be the road he mentioned.
6801,"If we follow this, it should lead to the station."
6802,Not the easiest surface to run on...
6803,We'd better not draw attention.
6804,"That's the station, I presume."
6805,......
6806,What're you looking at? This isn't a show!
6807,Huh...?
6808,Whaaa...?
6809,Can't wait to turn this into good coin and treat myself to a drink!
6810,Hm? Am I hearing things?
6811,Let's keep following him...while keeping a good distance.
6812,It gets a bit tight from here. We must be wary...
6813,That one looks like trouble. Must be an accomplice...
6814,"The streets of Radz–at–Han are most colorful, don't you think?"
6815,We must find whatever evidence we can and help that poor woman.
6816,Bweee!
6817,Whatever is the meaning of this!? Where is the satrap!?
6818,I... I saw it! That terrible beast...
6819,By the gods! Is everyone all right?
6820,"We escaped somehow, but... What in heavens' name is happening to our fair city!?"
6821,Surely the satrap will offer his wisdom and guidance to us...
6822,"The density, however..."
6823,When you put it that way...
6824,Will so much dust not cause respiratory problems?
6825,"It's fine to admit you're scared, you know?"
6826,"In the long run, however, most of you won't die!"
6827,That estimate seems accurate to me...
6828,Mew!
6829,"Mew, mew? Mew!"
6830,<chitter> <chitter> Hee!
6831,<chitter> Hee?
6832,<whirr>...
6833,Reassessing behavior.
6834,<blip> <bloop>
6835,
6836,That should do it.
6837,Are you quite certain?
6838,Just look at the size of it!
6839,It's not the size...
6840,I just adore this stained glass piece.
6841,Such amazing detail!
6842,Is “fair fortune” any good?
6843,"Er, what did it say again?"
6844,Probably?
6845,Says I should find me's a scuffle.
6846,R-Rabbits are the theme this year!?
6847,"What a curious custom,
this Heavensturn business."
6848,"Pay me lyin' whoreson o' a man a visit, then."
6849,You've tried five times already!
6850,Must...get...great...fortune...
6851,Mayhap I'll draw a lot myself...
6852,I demand we be friends!
6853,<sigh> Because of your fortune?
6854,They certainly seem to be enjoying themselves.
6855,"Hmm... More salt, maybe?"
6856,"Nothin' like a good scrub, eh?"
6857,Grub's fresh!
6858,Work's been pickin' up recently.
6859,Glad tidings indeed!
6860,Hmm...
6861,Can't we do somethin' 'bout this?
6862,"Hallo, chums."
6863,Hallo!
6864,How's it rollin'?
6865,"What do you reckon we do with this, eh?"
6866,Whatever the boss wants!
6867,I wonder what she's got in mind... Wanna ask?
6868,Open wide! Here comes another!
6869,"Oooh, now <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> a big mess."
6870,"There's a good hippo... You rest up, alright?"
6871,"We've found all the treasure, then?"
6872,What is this place?
6873,A hidden room within a hidden vault... 
6874,"Hmmm, a fitting sentinel..."
6875,"How about some hamsa skewers, sir?"
6876,How many fish is that fellow plannin' to eat...?
6877,"No, no! Fish! Bring me more fish!"
6878,You alright on parts there?
6879,That looks right...right?
6880,"Hey! Mind yourself, eh!?"
6881,Sisters bury me─I'm laaaaaate!
6882,"So far, so good! Thanks!"
6883,"So the difficult course starts from there, eh?"
6884,Congratulations!
6885,You're something else!
6886,Well done!
6887,<gulp> G-Gotta time it just right...
6888,"N-No, oh please no! I-I can't swim!"
6889,Looks awfully shallow down there...
6890,Just a little further...
6891,I can do this! I've come this far after all!
6892,"O-Okay, I'm ready to climb! I'll start aaany minute now..."
6893,The Eorzean Nimble Warrior course starts here!
6894,New circuit is this way!
6895,Come right this way for the new circuit!
6896,...
6897,I-I have to save him!
6898,The water feels great after those explosions!
6899,"Let's go, Porom!"
6900,"Like I need <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> to tell me that, Palom!"
6901,Well? Shall we give the new circuit a try?
6902,I say we do it!
6903,"Ooh, I'm sure it'll be a <Emphasis>blast</Emphasis>!"
6904,B-But what if we get hideous scars!?
6905,Not half bad!
6906,We're just gettin' warmed up!
6907,What a show!
6908,"He knows how to move his body, alright..."
6909,Can you hear that? The sound of my muscles expanding?
6910,"Feast your eyes on this pure, unadulterated muscle!"
6911,Why do I feel as if stalked by a slavering beast...
6912,<gulp> I wouldn't mind a bite of that...
6913,"When Khloe grows up, Khloe's gonna challenge the course too!"
6914,"Me too, me too!"
6915,I think I'll just watch from afar...
6916,I'll show everyone what the Maelstrom's made of!
6917,"It'll take more than water to scare the Flames! ...It's not cold, is it?"
6918,No turning back...not with the Adders' honor on the line!
6919,<squeal>
6920,How was it cooperating with others to craft explosives?
6921,"Very fun─good, interesting, fun!"
6922,'Tis absolutely sweltering─would that I had a cold drink.
6923,Somethin' oddly cute about these water bombs...
6924,"Well I'll be, didn't realize the course ain't the only attraction 'ere."
6925,"Kupopo! Seems like everyone's having a good time, kupo!"
6926,Is that Ba Go? Did he come to play?
6927,"Soon, it shall be my turn!"
6928,I don't understand...why not just ssswim?
6929,This one thinks this <Emphasis>challenge</Emphasis> is no challenge at all!
6930,"Squawk! This Nimble Warrior course, very intriguing!"
6931,The Gold Saucer? Can't say I've ever considered visiting the place...
6932,Talk about a stylish outfit!
6933,Countless wonders await you at the Manderville Gold Saucer!
6934,"One, two, three...!"
6935,What a lovely costume!
6936,I daresay that looks like fun!
6937,H-How many times do I have to tell ye!? I'm not bloody interested!
6938,Such hospitality! A man could get used to this!
6939,Kyokyoroon came for sparklies. Where are sparklies?
6940,Do allow me to guide you to the perfect spot to visit with your special someone.
6941,"Aye, now <Emphasis>this</Emphasis> is interestin'..."
6942,What in the gods' name is keepin' the bastard!?
6943,An' after I went out o' my way to extend an invitation...
6944,<Emphasis>Still</Emphasis> he has the gall to spurn me? Bah! I've a mind to gut 'im the instant he shows himself!
6945,The letter said that the duel was to take place here.
6946,...Yet it would seem my opponent is nowhere to be seen.
6947,"Anyhow, I have no time for this foolery. I will be on my way at once."
6948,"Why, the Gold Saucer's every bit as wonderful as I imagined─more so, even!"
6949,Sparklies! So many sparklies!
6950,I wonder what varieties of pudding they serve in this place?
6951,Well an' good to follow your heart─just don't follow it off a cliff.
6952,"“Don't follow heart off cliff”... Got it, sir!"
6953,"Oh, the places I want to see!"
6954,Nothing beats a hot bath after─what's this?
6955,I quite like this sort of elephant in the room!
6956,"Look, look! It's the Azure Elephant!"
6957,I daresay today's gains shall be plentiful.
6958,The rumors were true!
6959,"The Azure Elephant, guardian of Empyreum!"
6960,"Gents, I've a feeling today's our day."
6961,"To the Gold Saucer! <Emphasis>This</Emphasis> time, the Cactpot is ours!"
6962,I daresay we have passed the trial.
6963,Let us head back for now.
6964,Coming here together feels like a dream.
6965,"Then let neither of us wake, my darling."
6966,"That costume there! I helped design it, you know."
6967,"That's incredible, Taggy!"
6968,"These ones smell funny! Here, sniff!"
6969,I'm going to collect the prettiest shells in the whole universe...
6970,Ahhh...
6971,So many snacks ripe for the fishing!
6972,Please consume before constituent matter deliquesces.
6973,<whirr> Customer beverages must be replenished...
6974,Order registered.
6975,No residue detected. Table ready.
6976,Processing order...
6977,How many have you had!?
6978,Standing by for patron arrival.
6979,"Oh, they'll want to hear this..."
6980,Right...there!
6981,Next: Lights in the sky above the Carrotorium...
6982,Where did the other carrot couriers go...?
6983,Curiously hopeful inscriptions... Even mine!
6984,<wink>
6985,Boo!
6986,Meow...?
6987,Ooh!
6988,"Right this way, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>."
6989,"Oh, cheer up, darling!"
6990,"Um, can I go play?"
6991,"Yes, yes, up the stairs you go! Careful not to stub your toes!"
6992,Care to eat? Have a seat!
6993,Come to see the pumpkin patch? It really is a nice batch!
6994,Beyond here lies a place of rest...
6995,Would you rather be inside a pot or grave?
6996,"Oh my, we have a guest..."
6997,"Look at my pumpkins!
My wonderful pumpkins!"
6998,"Welcome, welcome!"
6999,<glare>
7000,...
7001,Meow!
7002,Ooh ooh! Ooh...ooh?
7003,What in the hells is going on here!?
7004,And here I thought monsters were on the loose...
7005,"Now then, what can I learn today?"
7006,Pumpkin pudding... It sounds simply marvelous!
7007,That was a fearsome foe.
7008,Who was that voidsent...?
7009,Is that it?
7010,"Transformation, hmm? Ladies, I've a wonderful idea for our next concert!"
7011,Isn't it just fascinating?
7012,What a peculiar festival.
7013,So this is the measure of a keyward's power...
7014,We weren't too late.
7015,So long as she lives there is yet hope.
7016,We've won!
7017,Now we end this.
7018,I sense a dreadful presence...
7019,This does not bode well.
7020,Does that...belong there?
7021,"Now, what do you think Mother would like?"
7022,Hmm...
7023,I know! A treat we can enjoy as a family!
7024,Hmm... How about a big cake?
7025,Carrot juice protocols active.
7026,I fear their levitation faculties are still developing...
7027,Mimimimi!♪
7028,Miii!
7029,<burble> ...Mi?
7030,"Oh, I couldn't possibly. What if the Fighters need it?"
7031,Why did she refuse to listen? Why didn't I...
7032,We're nearly to the summit. Let's keep moving.
7033,"...We should go, Ysayle. The summit awaits."
7034,On your guard. Our work here is not yet done.
7035,"Are you all right, my friend?"
7036,"We must hurry, ere the archbishop can make good his escape."
7037,Shall I leave this fertilizer here?
7038,Let the Citizens have this batch.
7039,Fertilizer delivery!
7040,You can stay─but tell no one.
7041,A suitable location for meditation.
7042,Quite. And we have much time.
7043,Which thesis shall we obliterate?
7044,Er...
7045,Have a dip!
7046,We must nourish them further. But how...
7047,Relax. They are already pleasingly gelatinous.
7048,This unit is but a tiny speck among the cosmos...
7049,Flora identification requested.
7050,"This tree represents the world─us, its leaves."
7051,<whirr> ...Interconnected units. As are we!
7052,Come back here!
7053,Perhaps Ra-la's is not the only blessing.
7054,"Still accounting for our differences, of course..."
7055,Not a bad idea.
7056,I suppose we can try it your way.
7057,Surface temperature: pleasing.
7058,Instructive! <beep> <beep> <beep> <BWAAAAAA>
7059,Pardon me─it appears I am experiencing an emotion...
7060,Relaxation...achieved?
7061,Downloading “ambling” add-on...
7062,"Share and share alike, I suppose."
7063,...Please just take it.
7064,The boldness of youth... This is well.
7065,Grew these with my own two hands!
7066,Just a little lick!
7067,Vital signs optimal. Hatchlings will grow large and robust.
7068,<yawn> Another beautiful day in─ Oh dear.
7069,"<gasp> It's the underworld, yes, yes!"
7070,"No, no, it must be a dream. Back to my jar..."
7071,"Underworld catfish! Help, heeelp!"
7072,Soup! Soup! Soup!
7073,"Waiter! Another, please!"
7074,Mi-miii!
7075,Mi mi mi mi...<screech>♪
7076,<burble>
7077,"I can scarcely take another hop, ribbit..."
7078,"Oh, for the time to pore over this collection..."
7079,"Now then, where might Master Matoya's tome be?"
7080,The aether here is almost too much for my eyes.
7081,So this is the closest point to the aetherial sea...
7082,"We've come for you, Minfilia..."
7083,I shan't soon forget this trial.
7084,I gave my all. I pray it was enough...
7085,The Ixal fought to the very last...
7086,"Tee hee hee! Go on, go on!"
7087,Watch it fidget! How adorable!
7088,"Tell me, do you like flowers?"
7089,"Kweh, kweh!"
7090,Just how powerful are these ryu...?
7091,Woooooo!
7092,"Yea! Yea, I say!"
7093,Mmmmmmuffin...
7094,Let's add it to my list...
7095,This looks fun!
7096,This looks tasty!
7097,How exciting!
7098,How lovely!
7099,Needs more carrots...
7100,At least we have plenty in stock!
7101,I could swear this was a whole cake last I checked...
7102,Baked to perfection!
7103,How sweet!
7104,Not quite golden brown yet...
7105,
7106,Am I allowed to play on this? Let's go with “yes”...
7107,Where are they?
7108,We're fully stocked!
7109,I present...this!
7110,It's very...this.
7111,S-Snake! There's a snake amongst the eggs!
7112,"My precious Archon egg...
They just...took it..."
7113,"Agh, my gift! Sunk to the bottom...
Those blasted sylphs!"
7114,"N-No more pranks... Cease this madness, I beg of you..."
7115,"Thanks to you, I was able to focus on the data collection."
7116,I believe we may declare this foray a success!
7117,
7118,
7119,"Gods, I'm exhausted. What's a woman have to do to get a bloody drink?"
7120,"Ah, Madam Rowena. A pleasure, as always."
7121,"Why, hello there. Won't you show me around your fine...establishment?"
7122,Those muscles... They're like tree trunks...
7123,What have we here? A craftsman after my own heart...
7124,Fascinating... A complex interplay between light and the wood's natural form. 
7125,"Can you catch us, kupo?"
7126,"So long as there's drink, I can manage..."
7127,"One moment poor as a pauper, the next rich as a king! Ah, what a magical place!"
7128,My readers would be very interested to know what items are on offer.
7129,"It's a good thing we found your mother, isn't it?"
7130,"Thank you, mister! Thank you!"
7131,This young lad was a great help in the search.
7132,The colors of summer should lend themselves splendidly to new garments.
7133,We're here to glean inspiration for Tataru Taru's Boutique!
7134,The sea here looks so different than in Thavnair... I could stare at it forever!
7135,"Oh, thank the gods Khloe is safe..."
7136,"Of course not, T'kebbe! The savior was amazing!"
7137,"You weren't scared, Khloe?"
7138,"We'll catch our fortunes soon enough, I can feel it!"
7139,I heard tell there's fish around here that'll fetch a whole sack of gil.
7140,Kweh! Kweh!
7141,
7142,Ungh... What the─!?
7143,"You almost have it, my lord!"
7144,"Guess your blue blood's not worth much here, eh?"
7145,"No one else saw that... Aye, no one else..."
7146,I'm so full of desserts... And so cold...
7147,I hear that a master of making confectionaries has come to enjoy the festivities.
7148,Everyone here's having so much fun!
7149,If only the moon had something like this...
7150,That's quite a few bombs. We may soon need a resupply...
7151,"Hehehe... Worry not. I have brought enough for many, many booms─blasts, bangs, booms!"
7152,Ungh... I can't do any better than this...?
7153,"You can do it! Go, go!"
7154,I believe in you!
7155,Yum yum!
7156,I won't doubt myself any longer!
7157,Don't worry!
7158,When it comes to water...
7159,...We're filled to the brim!
7160,This might be beyond me...
7161,One step at a time...
7162,So many bombs! Eeek!
7163,Easy does it...
7164,Come visit the memorial space when you have a moment!
7165,Glub...glub...glub...!
7166,Ahhh... Now that's refreshing!
7167,Come on... Just a little further...
7168,Quit faking or you'll distract the savior from <Emphasis>real</Emphasis> heroics!
7169,I can do this... Maybe.
7170,I can't fall...not again!
7171,Every failure just makes you stronger! Show us what you're made of!
7172,"If trouble comes knocking, the Sunshine Savior will scare it off!"
7173,Even if it's a shark that's thiiis big!
7174,H-Hey! Don't tempt fate like that!
7175,"What scent drew that shark here, I wonder?"
7176,Someone said there's a breathtaking vista next to the course.
7177,Really!? Promise we'll go later.
7178,"Welcome, welcome!"
7179,You did well to make it here!
7180,Such courage! Such grace!
7181,<Emphasis>That's</Emphasis> our savior? 
7182,"Aye, it takes courage to wear something like that..."
7183,The only thing better than making desserts is watching people tumble into the sea.
7184,"Oh, to be a chocobo chick in a dragon costume..."
7185,How precious!
7186,Sounds like it'll be smooth sailing for me this year!
7187,Hm. Maybe I should get me own blessin'...
7188,Why do you suppose they chose here for their lair?
7189,"Well, that was a challenge."
7190,So goes yet another archfiend.
7191,I've never seen a voidsent with such command over water.
7192,That they could open so large a gate is troubling.
7193,"I feel your presence, Sister. Where are you?"
7194,What if we volunteer to distribute eggs?
7195,Time to transform these eggs into adorable tonberries!
7196,Does that make them...toneggies?
7197,I do wish we could help somehow...
7198,"Well, what do you like to do?"
7199,I haven't the foggiest.
7200,Why not try inventing a machine?
7201,W-With wrenches!? Oooh...
7202,Are you interested in cooking?
7203,I do like to eat...
7204,How about painting?
7205,I don't have the talent. Or coordination...
7206,Would you like to be on the radio?
7207,Would I!?
7208,Did you find a dream?
7209,I found too many. Now I'm confused...
7210,What a nice uniform you have!
7211,Dreaming...
7212,My dream is to wear one of those uniforms!
7213,My dream is to have lunch at the cooking station!
7214,My dream is to have a dream!
7215,Aw...
7216,I'll be back─with a proper dream!
7217,I'm one of the Dreaming Ways now!
7218,...I'm not certain that counts.
7219,"Hail, my best Way!"
7220,Mayhap I'll interview the Thornes while I have the chance...
7221,"The Little Ladies' Dance...
I never thought I'd see it..."
7222,If only Claudia were alive to see this...
7223,"Perhaps this festival's better
than I gave it credit for."
7224,"Mother, it's beautiful!"
7225,For this year's celebration...
7226,We'll be distributing gorgeous fans to everyone!
7227,Please give us just a moment to prepare!
7228,"Behold, Princess Edvya's
Little Ladies' Dance!"
7229,You are all welcome to join us!
7230,There are enough fans for everyone!
7231,"Outfits that better highlight
the dance...color me intrigued!"
7232,What a cute dance!
7233,Do you think I can do it too?
7234,"Of course, dear. Just take it one step at a time."
7235,"What sort of fans, I wonder?"
7236,"Oooh, I can't wait!"
7237,I wonder what the Songbirds have planned...
7238,How very elegant!
7239,Perhaps I shall give it a try!
7240,The Songbirds are amazing!
7241,"The day has come, my friends...
Pudding has evolved!"
7242,I want you to make pudding! The best pudding in this realm or any other!
7243,
7244,These younglings are rooting for your success!
7245,"My, my, you're quite good at this!"
7246,I shall uncover this slippery secret!
7247,The architect of this space is truly a master of his craft...
7248,"What frightful mind thought these up, kupo?"
7249,"It's not that bad, kupo."
7250,"Oh, how can I possibly thank you!"
7251,Whoa! This isn't a closet at all!
7252,I know this song!
7253,White <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> blue! You're a miracle worker!
7254,Maybe they'll read mine next!
7255,My arms are getting tired...
7256,Ready to go?
7257,What took you so long?
7258,"I tripped! Tail over teakettle, straight into a creation station..."
7259,I'll climb you good!
7260,Hyaaahhh! No one messes with a pirate!
7261,Pace yerself!
7262,"Why, hello!"
7263,"The sea's callin' to ye, ain't she?"
7264,...
7265,I can't fall...not again!
7266,Thus the legend is unmasked...
7267,"Of all the eerie things here, that was definitely the eeriest."
7268,Now we can resume our voyage.
7269,I cannot put this isle behind us soon enough...
7270,"Finally, we may breathe easy..."
7271,Such a ferocious bird that was.
7272,We did it! We passed the trial!
7273,Let us press on to the keep!
7274,"Be safe, my lord..."
7275,I'm only just limbering up!
7276,I wonder how Lyse fares.
7277,What now...?
7278,"He <Emphasis>enjoyed</Emphasis> this, the monster..."
7279,It's not over yet. Stay sharp.
7280,"There's no escape, Zenos!"
7281,I guess not all adults are bad people...
7282,"Yeah, we've still got a lot of growing up to do!"
7283,You're right... Maybe we should go on an adventure someday!
7284,B-Be careful!
7285,"Actually, I have news of my own─I've earned a place in the interim government!"
7286,Did I tell you? I've started up my own business to support the town.
7287,Such a pleasant breeze...
7288,Would you just look at the stars...
7289,Nothing pairs with curry better than a breathtaking performance.
7290,"So, the thing about spicy foods is..."
7291,Perhaps it's time to expand our spice trade...
7292,Is there something you'd like to eat?
7293,"Ooh, the stew! Can you make it again?"
7294,Where do we go from here...
7295,The contingent should be along any moment now...
7296,"Oh, he'll be delighted! Have you decided what to make?"
7297,"Mother, I want to prepare supper for Father today!"
7298,"Just try to relax, dear."
7299,Will the medicine really help...?
7300,Seems the geyser is just beyond.
7301,Mayhap these waters are connected to the sea.
7302,"Had it been squid, we might have taken some for Estinien."
7303,Nothing to it.
7304,Did you hear?
7305,I heard on the radio...
7306,They're giving out candy at All Saints' Wake!
7307,I'm going to stuff myself with pudding!
7308,"Me, too!"
7309,Is this what the guild's been buzzing about...?
7310,I can't look!
7311,"A voidsent is close, I can smell it..."
7312,"Of course, it could be something else..."
7313,To think there could be monsters lurking about...
7314,"Not surprising, considering the origins of this occasion..."
7315,I've heard he goes wild for cookies.
7316,"I'm scared, but I can't look away..."
7317,I know what you mean...
7318,
7319,Quite the odd spectacle...
7320,My brothers will love this.
7321,"I heard rumors of monsters about, but it turns out it was all part of the festivities."
7322,Papa Gruff seems to be having so much fun!
7323,Maybe being liked isn't so bad after all!
7324,Thank goodness for warm meals...
7325,The damage to the city is even more extensive than we thought...
7326,What other materials might be reusable...?
7327,Our ceruleum stores are in good shape of late.
7328,What did you get for Starlight?
7329,Let's all play together!
7330,Witness the miracle of Starlight illusions!
7331,So many lovely presents!
7332,Not all gifts are gained with gil.
7333,I wonder if the Ehcatl Nine would enjoy the Starlight Celebration...
7334,"What's <Emphasis>'e</Emphasis> doin' 'ere, the blithe bastard!?"
7335,Is she here for celebration or assassination...?
7336,What do we have here...?
7337,"Oh? What is it, Ojika?"
7338,Just a little bit longer!
7339,Fascinating...
7340,"<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!?"
7341,"I-I saw you there, I assure you!"
7342,"Why not take a short break?
I'd be happy to assist afterwards."
7343,Come an' get yer Starlight presents!
7344,"Go on, then!"
7345,"If Khloe gets a gift, Khloe's gonna write a whole page about it in her journal..."
7346,So many letters of gratitude...
7347,I should write something too. Gods know I owe lots of people.
7348,Do you have aught to report?
7349,We must free the rest of our colleagues.
7350,Pandæmonium's protective wards have been restored.
7351,That Athena would build all this...
7352,This isn't all she's left behind.
7353,Where're the others?
7354,They're hiding somewhere. Let's go find 'em!
7355,"How long before they find us, you think?"
7356,"Well, they already know all the good hiding places..."
7357,"When they do, we should all go to the beach!"
7358,"Ooh, and then we can look at the stars until we fall asleep!"
7359,Piles upon piles of treasure... I can scarcely imagine how much there is.
7360,"Arenvald has gotten stronger, hasn't he?"
7361,To think that that monster used to be a man...
7362,That there in the distance...
7363,"Please be safe, Alphinaud..."
7364,That dragon was as much mist as it was flesh.
7365,Dragons at Allagan ruins are seldom a coincidence.
7366,It seems we've thrown them back.
7367,Is it over already?
7368,"Their teamwork was quite fearsome, I must allow."
7369,That Hyper Hustle was incredible!
7370,"Pure fiction, beyond a doubt."
7371,"Zzz... Forward, brave hippo..."
7372,It's just as our listeners described!
7373,Was there truly no other way?
7374,He all but set his soul aflame...
7375,It should not have come to this.
7376,A bitter victory...
7377,Did you get that feedback down?
7378,"Listeners...indignant...yet...
thrilled..."
7379,'Tis already quite impressive to behold.
7380,Ook!
7381,So it's temporarily constructed with wood.
7382,"Ah, such an invigorating breeze..."
7383,"Ook, ook!"
7384,"Oh, Etheirys..."
7385,Your beauty truly knows no bounds.
7386,"Forgive me, I was lost in thought."
7387,I look forward to the bridge's completion.
7398,Lord Golbez!
7399,And Lord Durante too!
7400,Hope is not yet lost!
7401,Our saviors have returned!
7402,Ka-pa-paaa!
7403,These imps don't hold a candle to Senor Sabotender...!
7404,"Please, my darling, won't you let me take you to dinner?"
7405,"Oh fine, if you insist..."
7406,So <Emphasis>that's</Emphasis> how you do it...
7407,Here goes nothing...
7408,M-Milady?
7409,She'll make a fine emissary of love yet.
7410,Emilie's giving it her all!
7411,Imps! My buddies! My pals!
7412,"Well now, that we should visit this place at the same time..."
7413,"All is well with the instrument, and I trust 'tis likewise with you."
7414,"Take care, my friend. Till next we meet."
7415,Find anything yet?
7416,Thank you for coming!
7417,We hope you enjoy yourselves!
7418,Next is the main attraction!
7419,Little Ladies' Day is far from over!
7420,It'll be eggcellent!
7421,Things are just heating up!
7422,Ulala! Look at me!
7423,Such grace!
7424,"Yes, woo! Woo, I say!"
7425,Three cheers for the Beans!
