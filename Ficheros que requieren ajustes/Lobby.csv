110,Hyur<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"The Hyur are said to have first traveled to Eorzea from her surrounding
continents and islands. Three great migratory waves later, they are now
the most populous of all the civilized races. They exhibit a relatively
modest physique, both in height and build, and are known for their
peculiarly short, rounded ears. Hyurs are well suited for traveling long
distances by foot, a trait thought to account for their swift proliferation.

Their espousal of an eclectic variety of languages and traditions is
a legacy of their diverse heritage－as is their resulting lack of a
unified cultural identity."
111,,,
112,Elezen<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"In former times, the Elezen were the sole inhabitants of Eorzea,
claiming dominion over her. Traditionally a nomadic people, the tall,
slender Elezen believed the realm to be theirs by divine right.
Unfortunately, this belief made the eventual appearance of the
Hyur in their multitudes akin to an invasion, and a long history of
conflict ensued.

Ultimately, the Elezen diverged into the two clans that exist today.
The Wildwood Elezen took to the forests to protect their homeland,
while the Duskwight Elezen withdrew to caves and subterrane, opting
instead to avoid all contact with any but their own."
113,,,
114,Lalafell<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"A wee people sporting short, rotund bodies, the Lalafell appear as
no more than children to the eyes of most. Many of these nimble
little folk hail from the islands of the south seas, where they practice
a simple agricultural lifestyle. It was not until the opening of maritime
trade routes that the gradual migration of Lalafells to Eorzea began.

Now one of the most well-established races in the realm, Lalafells
can be found in great numbers in nearly every city. Though Lalafellin
culture places great emphasis on blood relations, individuals are known
for getting along amicably with members of all races."
115,,,
116,Miqo'te<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"The ancestors of the Miqo'te made their way to Eorzea during the
Age of Endless Frost, traversing the frozen seas in pursuit of the
wildlife upon which they subsisted. Adaptation to a hunting lifestyle
has fashioned them with a keen sense of smell, powerful legs, and
a tail which provides them with exceptional balance.

Miqo'te are known to be very territorial, and many individuals tend
to lead solitary lifestyles, particularly males."
117,,,
118,Roegadyn<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"Known for their brawny builds and piercing eyes, the Roegadyn
are the largest and most rugged of Eorzea's races. The majority
of the realm's Roegadyn belong to the Sea Wolf clan, a maritime
people who earn their keep on or by the sea, be it as sailors,
fishermen, or pirates. Comparatively fewer in number are the
Hellsguard, who are known for their more earnest demeanors
and can often be found working as bodyguards and smithies."
119,,,
120,Midlander,,"The Midlander clan comprises over half of the total population of
Eorzea's Hyurs. They have established themselves throughout
every city in the realm and lead lives as diverse as their heritage.

Trained in letters from infancy, the Midlanders are generally more
educated than many of the other races and clans. Despite the fact
that males tend to be slightly taller than females, there are no
significant differences between the genders."
121,,,
122,Highlander,,"The Highlanders were the first of the Hyur to reach Eorzea.
Their name derives from their long tradition of building strongholds
in the mountains. Compared to their Midland brethren, the
Highlanders are noticeably larger in build.

Of late, Highlanders have become an increasingly rare sight
in Eorzea, their number represented almost exclusively by those
who fled Ala Mhigo after its fall and now work in the desert
city-state of Ul'dah as mercenaries and sellswords."
123,,,
124,Wildwood,,"For hundreds of years, the Wildwood Elezen have lived in the
relative safety of Eorzea's lush forests. With the formation of
Eorzea's governments, however, many Wildwood ventured forth
from the forests, drawn to the exhilarating cosmopolitanism of
nearby Gridania. There is minimal dimorphism between the two
genders, though males are generally considered to be milder and
more chivalrous in demeanor. Among their Duskwight brethren,
Wildwood Elezen are referred to as Greens, for their love of the forest."
125,,,
126,Duskwight,,"Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and
seclusion in the depths of Eorzea's caves and caverns. Today,
they are called the Duskwight, though to their Wildwood cousins
they are known simply as the Greys, after their preference for
darkness and stone.

The cave-dwelling ways of the Duskwight persist, with some
among them turning to robbery and pillaging to survive, earning
them the scorn of their woodland relatives. There are few
differences between the genders, but Duskwight females are
often regarded as being the more passionate and unyielding of
the two."
127,,,
128,Plainsfolk,,"From the flat landscapes of the Plainsfolk's home islands are where
this Lalafellin clan takes its name. Their distinct hair coloration－
a myriad of earthy and grassy tones－helps them to blend in well
with their environment, acting as an effective camouflage against
would-be attackers. It was the similarity of La Noscea's grassy
fields to those in their homeland which drew the first settlers to
the island of Vylbrand and what is now Limsa Lominsa.

They are a clever and opportunistic people, and crafty with
their words. The generally accepted view of Plainsfolk is that
they are a vibrant lot, with a penchant for excessive conversation."
129,,,
130,Dunesfolk,,"Perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Dunesfolk is their
luminous eyes─a result of a glossy, protective layer which covers
the pupil, an evolutionary response to their homeland's glaring sunlight.
Many individuals wear a small, traditional gemstone on their forehead,
a symbol of their zodiacal sign. They are adamant about scholasticism,
placing the advancement of knowledge before all else. Other races
tend to perceive male Dunesfolk as introverts who care more for
books, business, and the prosperity of Ul'dah─a city-state built upon
Dunesfolk ingenuity─than the goings-on of the rest of the realm."
131,,,
132,Seekers of the Sun,,"The self-proclaimed Seekers of the Sun are the diurnal clan of
the Miqo'te race. Their preference for the warm light of day
pervades all aspects of their culture, as is apparent in their
devout reverence for Azeyma, the Warden, keeper of the sun
and goddess of inquiry.

They are perhaps known best for their striking eyes－the result
of their vertically aligned pupils and faintly colored irises. It is also
not uncommon for their eyes to be disparately colored from birth,
a trait considered auspicious amongst their kind.

Seeker tribes can be found throughout Eorzea, with large
concentrations appearing near Limsa Lominsa and the Sagolii Desert."
133,,,
134,Keepers of the Moon,,"The nocturnal among the Miqo'te have dubbed themselves the
Keepers of the Moon. Shying from the garish light of day, they
revel in the shroud of night, with most offering their piety to
Menphina, the Lover, goddess of the moon.

They are distinguishable from their diurnal cousins by their
darker fur, larger ears, rounder eyes, more pronounced canines,
and longer, skinnier tails. The ritual application of war paint to
the face is still regularly practiced, as it is believed the vivid
colors grant lunar powers.

After a great many summers of conflict with the people of
Gridania, the Keepers have finally made amends with the
people of the sylvan city-state, with some even choosing
to make their homes there."
135,,,
136,Sea Wolves,,"Long ago, no vessel or coastal village was safe from
the fury of the Sea Wolves and their maritime brand
of brutality. The mere mention of the clan was enough
to strike fear into the hearts of any who drew their
livelihood from the sea. The Sea Wolves originally hail
from the islands of the far north seas, where they still
subsist as fishermen and women.

It was not until the large-scale deployment of Limsa
Lominsa's armada that the Sea Wolves' appetite for
piracy diminished. Now, it is not uncommon to see them
employed as sailors or naval mercenaries on all manner
of vessels. However, they have never forgotten the
ways of their homeland, and still use the ancient
Roegadyn language in their names."
137,,,
138,Hellsguard,,"The Hellsguard are a Roegadyn clan with body and mind
tempered by the unforgiving heat of the volcanic regions
they inhabit. Believing these mountains of flame to be
gates to the underworld, their line has for centuries
stood vigil to prevent the passage of souls back to the
realm of the living.

As the harsh environs of their homelands produce
little sustenance, the second- and third-born are often
sent forth from their mountain villages, with many and
more making their way to the great cities. It is there that
their sheer girth and steely demeanors place them in
high demand as soldiers and sellswords, allowing the
young of even the largest families to surpass their
elder siblings in prosperity."
139,,,
140,Au Ra<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"The curved horns and beautifully patterned scales that characterize
the Au Ra oft give rise to speculation that members of this Hyur-like
race native to the Far Eastern continent of Othard are, in fact, the
progeny of dragons. This, however, has long been disputed, with
scholars citing several distinct differences in the two races as
evidence of decidedly dissimilar roots─the first and foremost being
the enhanced hearing and spatial recognition granted by an Au Ra's
cranial projections (traits not attributed to draconian horns), and the
second being the gross disproportion in body mass between Auri
males and females (again, a trait widely unseen in dragons)."
141,,,
142,Raen,,"Auri creation myth tells of a Dawn Father and a
Dusk Mother from whom all Au Ra are descended.
The Raen believe their veins to run thick with the
blood of the former─their brilliant white scales and
iron wills serving as proof of this divine lineage.

Unlike their sister clan, the Xaela, who bloody the
land with endless tribal conflict, the Raen have
embraced a life of tranquility and solitude, long
abandoning the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors
to settle the deep valleys of Othard's mountainous
eastern reaches. Only on rare occasions will one
emerge from the valley mists to seek adventure
in realms afar."
143,,,
144,Xaela,,"Auri creation myth tells of a Dawn Father and a
Dusk Mother from whom all Au Ra are descended.
The Xaela believe their veins to run thick with the
blood of the latter─their lustrous black scales and
fiery wills serving as proof of this divine lineage.

Unlike their sister clan, the Raen, who lead solitary
lives hidden behind the savage peaks of Othard's
eastern reaches, the Xaela are free spirits who
roam the vast western steppe in close-knit tribes
hunting, gathering, and warring as their ancestors
have for countless generations."

178,Gladiator,,"Gladiators specialize in the handling of all manner of one-handed
blades, from daggers to longswords, be they single- or double-edged,
straight or curved. A defining characteristic of the art is its emphasis
on diverse combat tactics, training its members to bring their martial
skills to bear in any situation. As such, there are practitioners who
marry sword with shield, seeking to defend their fellow companions.
Others opt for an empty off hand, choosing instead to focus entirely
on their sword arm. In all instances, the ages-old art of the sword
makes the gladiator a formidable adversary in any encounter."
179,,,
180,Pugilist,,"The path of the pugilist is one of incessant training aimed at mastering
the traditional techniques of hand-to-hand combat. Though they
command formidable power when unarmed, they are wont to use metal,
leather, and bone weaponry to maximize their destructive potential.

Their preference for fighting at close quarters makes negotiating
distances an absolute necessity. This is why many pugilists are quick
to learn that lightweight gear allowing for maximum agility ensures them
better success in battle than does cumbersome plate or chain."
181,,,
182,Marauder,,"The marauder is a combat specialist whose weapon of choice is
the greataxe－a fearsome arm emblematic of Eorzea's pirates.
Their approach to battle is one of brute force, relying on strength
and steel to crush enemies and sunder weapons. They are highly
sought after for their ferocity and intimidating presence, and are
often employed to hunt down monsters plaguing the land, or to turn
the tide of battle between warring nations."
183,,,
184,Lancer,,"The strategy of the lancers is to outrange and fluster opponents
with their long, two-handed polearms, peppering them with a barrage
of thrusting attacks. They are trained with a number of weapons,
giving a diversity to their attacks that makes them extremely
versatile combatants.

In former times, the longspear saw the most widespread use,
due in great part to the influence of the proud lancer legions of
Ala Mhigo. Since then, the guild has greatly expanded its armories
to include a variety of weaponry, such as the halberd and the trident."
185,,,
186,Archer,,"The enduring popularity of the bow is a testament to its elegant
design, but this simple weapon would be of little worth without the
surpassing skill of those who master it－the archers. Projectile
techniques such as high-angle fire enable archers to assail their
foes with deadly precision even at great distances.

Constant assessment of the battlefield enables them to carefully
determine the most advantageous ground from which to loose,
as well as the nature of the arrows best suited to their enemy.
Together with the longbow sentries of the Elezen military, the
shortbow hunters among the Miqo'te are widely regarded as
most skilled with the bow."
187,,,
188,Conjurer,,"Conjury calls upon elemental forces present in nature and concentrates
them to a potency at which spells can be woven. Through practiced
meditation on the essences of creation, conjurers draw forth and
absorb aether from their immediate surroundings. A wand or cane
made from unworked wood is then utilized to focus the aether until it
manifests as the desired spell. The seat of the Conjurers' Guild lies at
Stillglade Fane in Gridania, where the voices of Eorzea's elementals are
said to be most powerful."
189,,,
190,Thaumaturge,,"In the hands of a skilled practitioner, thaumaturgy can be a force of
terrifying destruction. At the heart of this school of magic lies the
ability to call forth and command the latent aether within oneself
through deep introspection. To then mold that aether into sorcery,
the thaumaturge makes use of a scepter or staff, within which is
housed a medium－a natural stone imbued with magical properties."
191,,,
192,Arcanist,,"Adepts of the art of arcanum derive their might from symbols of power
born of geometric techniques hailing from across the southern seas.
Held within occult grimoires, these symbols lend shape to the arcanist's
aether, thereby allowing him to produce myriad powerful spells. Using

458,Hrothgar<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"Hailing from the distant shores of Ilsabard, the Hrothgar are a burly
people of lionlike appearance—or the males are, at least. Females
number staggeringly few among their population, and thus are
rarely so much as glimpsed by the other races.

The Hrothgar's imposing countenance─mitigated not at all by their
sharp claws and still sharper fangs—incited panic amongst
Eorzeans upon their arrival. As they were also unable to
communicate, initial interactions with the commonfolk often
escalated into conflict. It was not until the Hrothgar gained mastery
of the common tongue that fears were allayed, and in time they
would be as neighbors, welcome in all corners of the realm."
459,,,
460,Viera<Switch(IntegerParameter(1))><Case(1)> ©</Case><Case(2)> ®</Case><Case(3)></Case></Switch>,,"Of tall stature and slender frame, the Viera's physical appearance is
strikingly similar to that of the Hyur and Elezen, save for their
distinctive long ears. Adhering to a strict code known as the Green
Word, they are prohibited from contact with the outside world under
threat of exile. Their society is purely matriarchal, and males of age
are seldom, if ever, found within the bounds of any village. They
instead serve as protectors of the wood from the shadows, that no
evil may ever encroach on their sacred lands."
461,,,
462,Helions,,"Helions have traditionally been content to reside in southern Ilsabard
with their respective tribes, devout servants to their queens,
one and all—and thus have they only but recently begun to make
their presence felt throughout the remainder of the three continents.
Though these Hrothgar initially had no word to describe themselves,
scholars came to call them ""Helions"" after observing how their lives
all but revolved about their queen's needs, as planets circle the sun."
463,,,
464,The Lost,,"Unlike their Helion brethren, the Lost are unbound by the whims of any
reigning monarch, having long since found themselves bereft of the
warm radiance of their queen. Most find that a nomadic lifestyle
best suits their situation, and are known to ply a variety of trades
that align with their propensity to travel—seasonal laborer,
mercenary, and peddler among them."
465,,,
466,Rava,,"Viera of the Rava clan live primarily in the Golmore Jungle, their
umber skin allowing them to readily blend in with their surroundings.
Though the males stand as wards of the forest, the females are
adept hunters and protectors in their own right, fiercely guarding their homes and
their young. Despite attempts by the Dalmascans to subjugate
them, they have ever maintained a self-governing dominion. Though
most would adhere to the traditions of the wood, some few have
chosen to venture out into the world."
467,,,
468,Veena,,"With skin as fair as the snowcapped mountains towering above, the
Veena clan make their homes in the forests lining the southwestern
foothills of the Skatay Range. Like the members of their sister clan,
the Veena live as hunters and gatherers, laboring not only to protect
the woods, but to nurture them. As the winds of war swept up a
number of those who left their mountain homes, many such
hardened hunters chose to set out for the distant shores of Eorzea."
469,,,
470,,,
471,"Halone, mover of glaciers and goddess of war, is the

Once you have chosen a Home World, chances to move to another will be limited,
so if you have made plans to play FINAL FANTASY XIV with friends, make
certain that you all select the same one.

Worlds are divided between nine different data centers based on the location of
their servers. To ensure you encounter the fewest number of latency issues,
it is recommended, but not required, that you select a data center that is
closer to where you will be playing. Legacy Worlds (servers existing since the
original launch) are indicated in parentheses.

1980,Limsa Lominsa,,"On the southern coast of the island of Vylbrand, under the shadow of
ancient cliffs worn by the relentless onslaught of the Rhotano Sea,
lies the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa. Its economy is driven
primarily by shipping, but boasts lucrative shipbuilding, fishing, and
smithing industries as well. To maintain the safety of its maritime
routes, the city employs a formidable navy known as the Knights
of the Barracuda. Even so, pirate bands run rampant in nearby waters,
reaving and pillaging."
1981,Gridania,,"In the eastern reaches of the Aldenard landmass, home to vast, dense
woodlands and coursing rivers, lies the forest nation of Gridania. The
cityscape is a mosaic of labyrinthine waterways and great wooden
structures, so gracefully constructed they seem a part of the
surrounding environment. The favored goddess of the citizenry is
Nophica, the Matron, but great faith is also placed in the wisdom of
the Seedseers－young oracles who guide the nation based on the
will of the forest's elementals."
1982,Ul'dah,,"The bustling commercial hub of Ul'dah sits amid the desolate desert
landscape of southern Aldenard. Ul'dahn culture is known for its
affluence, and the wealth of the nation comes in large part from its
abundant mineral resources and clothcrafting industry. Though it is
the sultana who claims sovereignty, true power is wielded by the
Syndicate, a council sat by six of Ul'dah's most elite and influential.
Nald'thal is the nation's patron deity, and two great halls devoted to
His two aspects lie in the east and west of the city."
